<h3>
PREFACE.
</h3>
</div>
<hr class="short">

<p><span class="muchlarger smcap">If</span> an apology for the following translation
cannot be found in the work itself,
it would be to little purpose to insert it
in the Preface. I have attempted to
present to the public the most celebrated
dramatist of ancient Rome, in
such a dress as may enable the English
reader, learned and unlearned equally,
to relish, in his own language, the
beauties of this great poet. Though
the original is composed in verse, I
have employed prose in this translation,
because the verse of Terence approaches
so very nearly to prose, that in prose only
is it possible to adhere faithfully to the
words, and particularly to the style of
our author; as we have in our language
no measure of verse at all corresponding
with that used by Terence.</p>

<p>To the learned reader, the number of
the subjoined Notes may, perhaps,
seem excessive; and the minuteness of
description which characterizes many of
them, may appear unnecessary; but,
though this work was not written professedly
for the schools, yet the Notes
were not composed entirely without a
view to the instruction of the young
student; and, as translations are supposed
to be made chiefly for the use of
the unlearned, who cannot be expected
to be much acquainted with the manners
and customs of the ancients; I
thought it better, if I erred at all, to
err on the safe side, and to repeat to
some of my readers something that they
knew before, rather than run the risk of
permitting any one of them to remain
unacquainted with it altogether. A
French translator of Terence, the
learned and indefatigable Madame Dacier,
has judged a still greater number
of Notes than I have subjoined in this
work, necessary to elucidate various
passages in her translation of the play
of the Andrian, and of Suetonius’s Life
of our author. One remark may be
added on this subject; it must be considered
that many of the explanatory
Notes affixed to the play of the Andrian,
tend to the general elucidation of the
various passages in the remaining five
plays of Terence; and I think I may
venture to hope, that the Notes in general,
will, in many instances, be found
useful in the exposition of many passages
in the Latin and Greek classics.</p>

<p>I am induced to publish this play
singly, with a view of ascertaining whether
a translation of Terence’s comedies
on this plan may meet with sufficient
approbation to encourage the appearance
of the remaining five plays: as I
propose to give a complete translation
of the works of this celebrated author,
if the present attempt should be honoured
with a favourable reception. I
may say, in the words of Terence himself,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Favete, adeste æquo animo, et rem cognoscite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ut pernoscatis, ecquid spei sit reliquum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Posthac quas faciet de integro comœdias,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spectandæ, an exigendæ sint vobis priùs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And now deign to favour the play with your attention,
and give it an impartial hearing, that you
may know what is in future to be expected from the
poet, and whether the comedies that he may write
hereafter, will be worthy to be accepted, or to be
rejected by you.—<cite>Prologue to the Andrian.</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquote-->

<p>These lines contain very strong presumptive
proof that the Andrian was
Terence’s first production; and, for that
reason, it has been selected for this
essay, and not on account of its being
supposed to be superior to his other
plays: for so great, so steady was the
equality of this poet’s genius, that no
critic of eminence, ancient or modern,
could ever yet venture to assign to any
one of his plays a claim of superiority to
the rest. The celebrated Scaliger has
asserted that there were not more than
<em>three</em> faults in the <em>six</em> plays of Terence.</p>

<p>The ancients seem to have been least
partial to the Step-mother: Volcatius
says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Sumetur Hecyra sexta ex his fabula.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Step-mother is reckoned the last
of the six. This was the only piece
written by our author, in which the plot
was single; and the want of a double
plot, which the Romans then preferred,
was, doubtless, the reason of its being
postponed to Terence’s other productions.</p>

<p>The force of custom has given authority
to an erroneous disposition of these
comedies, which are usually printed in
the following order:</p>


<ul><li>The Andrian,</li>
<li>The Eunuch,</li>
<li>The Self-tormentor,</li>
<li>The Brothers,</li>
<li>The Step-mother,</li>
<li>The Phormio.</li>
</ul>

<p>They were written and represented at
Rome as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td></td>
    <td class="tdc"><span class="smaller">Year of Rome.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Andrian</td>
    <td class="tdc">587</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Step-mother</td>
    <td class="tdc">588</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Self-tormentor</td>
    <td class="tdc">590</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Eunuch</td>
    <td class="tdc">592</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Phormio</td>
    <td class="tdc">592</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">The Brothers</td>
    <td class="tdc">593</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The original cause of the order of
these plays being changed by the ancient
transcribers is not known; though
it is conjectured that they classed them
thus, that the four plays taken from
Menander might be placed together.
This leads me to mention Terence’s
close imitation of the Greek dramatists,
amounting, in fact, to a partial translation
of them; and it is necessary to bear
this in mind during a perusal of his
writings, lest, under the impression that
<a id="chg3"></a>this author wrote originally in <em>Latin</em>, the
reader should forget that the scene is
always laid in Greece; that the persons
of the drama are not Romans but
Greeks; and that, consequently, the
manners, customs, names, and things,
there mentioned, are almost uniformly
Grecian.</p>

<p>Roman literature had emerged from
obscurity just previous to the times
of Terence: that sun, which was destined
to shed its splendour over all future
ages, was then scarcely risen from the
darkness which shrouded it during the
rude infancy of the Roman commonwealth;
and even for a long period
after Rome assumed the highest rank in
the scale of nations. Livius Andronicus,
the first poet of eminence, wrote
dramatic pieces in the year of Rome
513. He was followed by Nævius, Ennius,
Tegula, and Cæcilius; next comes
Pacuvius, who excelled in tragedies;
then follow Plautus and his cotemporaries
Plautius, Aquilius, and Acutius;
and, lastly, Terence brought the Latin
drama to its highest perfection about the
year of Rome 590, eighty years after its
first appearance. But, in Greece, dramatic
writing had attained the highest
pitch of excellence under Menander,
more than one hundred years before;
and the Latin poets copied most closely
from the refined writings of the Greeks.
At that time, and for many years after,
Greek was almost as much in fashion at
Rome, as French has of late years been
in fashion in England: it formed a necessary
branch of a polite education;
and many of the Romans quitted their
native city, and resided in Greece a
considerable time, for the purpose of
perfecting themselves in the Greek language,
and enjoying the advantage of
associating themselves with the philosophers
and other learned men of that
country.</p>

<p>Our author, therefore, complied with
the taste of the age, and no man succeeded
better in making the Greek
poets speak Latin. He copied chiefly
from Menander: the four entire plays,
the Andrian, the Eunuch, the Self-tormentor,
and the Brothers, were taken
from the writings of that great poet, as
were also some parts of the Step-mother
and the Phormio.</p>

<p>Terence’s great rival in dramatic fame
was Marcus Accius Plautus, who flourished
a few years before him; and has
left twenty comedies replete with wit
and spirit. To draw a comparison at
length, between these great poets,
would be an undertaking by no means
suited to a Preface; and far more arduous
than I should at present feel prepared
to enter into: the learned Madame
Dacier very happily observes,
<span lang="fr">“Il est certain qu’il n’y a rien de plus
difficile que cette espèce de critique qui
consiste à juger des hommes, et à faire
voir les avantages qu’ils ont les uns sur
les autres. Il y a tant d’égards à observer;
tant de rapports à unir, tant de
différences à peser, que c’est une chose
presque infinie; et il semble que pour
s’en bien acquitter, il faudroit avoir une
esprit supérieur à ceux dont on juge,
comme il est nécessaire que la main qui
se sert d’une balance soit plus forte que
les choses quelle veut peser.”</span>—It is
certain, that no species of criticism is
more difficult than that which consists
of judging generally of an author;
and in pointing out those excellencies,
in which he is superior to other writers.
There are so many points to be considered,
so many similarities to be compared
with each other, so many differences
to be weighed against each
other, that the task is almost endless;
and appears to require talents superior
to those of the person whose productions
are to be criticised; as the hand
which holds the balance ought to possess
a power more than equal to the
weight of whatever is to be placed
in it.</p>

<p>Most of those critics who have undertaken
to compare Terence and Plautus
with each other, have, on a general
estimate of their merits, decided in
favour of Terence; though in one or
two particular excellencies they allow
Plautus to have surpassed him. They
judged Plautus to be chiefly recommended
by his humour, by the amusing
variety of his incidents, by the liveliness
and spirit of his action, and by his
rich, agreeable, and witty style. Terence
they praise for his delicacy of
expression, his unequalled skill in the
delineation of characters and of manners,
and in the construction and management
of his plots, for the well-timed
introduction of his incidents, and
for the evenness, purity, and chasteness
of his style.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Terence stands unrivalled.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One natural defect the critics have
charged Terence with, and only one,
<abbr title="namely"><i>viz.</i></abbr>, the want of what the ancients
called the <i>vis comica</i>, which is usually
interpreted <i>humour</i>: and, in this requisite,
they judged him to have fallen
short of Plautus. One fault also is objected
against him, being no less than a
direct breach of the rules of dramatic
writing; which is, that he makes the
actors directly address the audience in
their assumed characters; as in the
fourth scene of the first act of the Andrian,
and also in the last scene of the
last act. Against the latter charge, no
defence can be made, except we urge
the authority of custom; but the imputation
against our author of a want
of humour may, in a great measure, be
repelled.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la">vis comica</i> of the ancients, though
we translate it by the word <i>humour</i>, which
approaches nearer to its true signification
than any other expression in our language,
could not have been exactly the
same kind of humour with that of our own
times; which has been usually considered
as peculiar to the English drama, and has
not even a name in any other modern
language. If we allow the <i lang="la">vis comica</i>, or
comic force, to be divided into two
species, namely, the <i lang="la">vis comica</i> of the
action, and the <i lang="la">vis comica</i> of the dialogue,
(and is there not a humour of action, as
there is of words?) we must also allow,
that Terence’s writings, far from being
devoid of the humour of action, are replete
with it throughout. The Eunuch,
particularly, abounds with this kind of
humour, especially in the eighth scene
of the fourth act, where Thraso forms
his line of battle; and, in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh scenes of the last act,
between Laches, Pythias, and Parmeno,
which are specimens of the <i lang="la">vis comica of
action</i>, not inferior to many of the witty
Plautus’s attempts to exhibit this species
of dramatic manners.</p>

<p>I shall conclude by giving the reader
some account of the rise and conduct
of dramatic entertainments at Rome:
which cannot be so conveniently introduced
in the Notes. A knowledge of
these things is very necessary to a right
understanding of Terence’s plays; as
his mode of writing could not be reconciled
to the modern method of dramatic
representation, which differs very materially
from the ancient manner.</p>

<p>About an hundred and twenty years
before regular plays were first exhibited
at Rome, a sort of entertainment
called <i lang="la">ludi scenici</i> was introduced there
by the Etrurians: it consisted merely
of dancing to the sound of a pipe. This
simple amusement was soon improved
upon, and the dancers began also to
speak. They spouted a species of rude
satirical verses, in which they threw
out rough jests, raillery, and repartee
against each other: these were called
Saturnian verses, or Satires, from their
god Saturn: hence this name was afterwards
applied to poetry composed for
the purpose of lashing vice or folly.
The Saturnian verses, set to music, and
accompanied by dancing, continued a
favourite diversion, till they were superseded
by regular plays about the
year of Rome 515. The places where
they were represented, (called theatra,
theatres, from a Greek word signifying
<dfn>to see</dfn>,) were originally tents, erected in
the country, under the shade of some
lofty trees: afterwards they performed
in temporary buildings formed of wood:
one of these is recorded to have been
large enough to contain eighty thousand
spectators. Pompey the Great erected
the first permanent theatre: it was
built of stone, and of a size sufficient
to accommodate forty thousand persons.</p>

<p>Some critics have objected against
Terence, that he is guilty of an impropriety
in making one actor speak very
frequently without being heard by another;
and introducing two or more persons
on the stage, who, though they are
both of them seen by the spectators,
yet do not perceive each other for a
considerable space of time. These objections
are easily answered when we
reflect on the magnificent size of the
Roman theatres. An ingenious writer
of the last century has given a very
clear explanation of this subject: I shall
give it in his own words.</p>

<p>“Some make this objection, that in
the beginning of many scenes, two actors
enter upon the stage, and talk to
themselves a considerable time before
they see or know one another; which
they say is neither probable nor natural.
Those that object to this don’t consider
the great difference between our little
scanty stage and the large magnificent
Roman theatres. Their stage was sixty
yards wide in the front, their scenes so
many streets meeting together, with all
by-lanes, rows, and alleys; so that two
actors coming down two different streets
or lanes, couldn’t be seen by each
other, though the spectators might see
both; and sometimes, if they did see
each other, they couldn’t well distinguish
faces at sixty yards’ distance.
Besides, upon several accounts, it
might well be supposed when an actor
enters upon the stage out of some house,
he might take a turn or two under the
porticoes, cloisters, or the like, (that
were usual at that time,) about his
door, and take no notice of an actor’s
being on the other side of the
stage.”</p>

<p>Of course, the extensive size of the
Roman theatres made it impossible that
the natural voice of the actors should
be distinctly heard at the distance they
stood from the audience: to remedy
this inconvenience, they had recourse
to a sort of mask, which covered both
the head and the face: it was called
<dfn>persona</dfn>, from two Latin words, signifying
to <dfn>sound through</dfn>: the mouth of this
mask was made very large, and with
thin plates of brass they contrived to
swell the sound of the voice, and, at
the same time, to vary its tones, so
as to accord with the passions they
wished to express. Instructions in the
use of these masks formed an essential
and important branch of the education
of a Roman actor.</p>

<p>The plays represented at Rome were
divided into two classes: 1. the palliatæ,
2. the togatæ. In the first, the characters
of the piece were entirely Grecian:
in the latter, they were entirely
Roman. The second class, <i><abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></i>, the
togatæ, were subdivided into the prætextatæ,
when the play was tragedy:
the tabernariæ, when the scenes lay in
low life: the atellanæ, or farces: and
the trabeatæ, when the scene lay in the
camp: they had likewise mimes and
pantomimes.</p>

<p>The chorus consisted sometimes of
one person, though generally of several,
who stood on the stage during the representation,
at first, without any share
in the action of the piece: some suppose
that they were there partly in the
character of spectators: if this conjecture
be correct, Terence may be excused
for making the actors address
them. Their business seems originally
to have been singing between the pauses
in the action, and delivering moral reflections
on what was represented on
the stage: afterwards they were incorporated
with the action, as a species of
attendants. These theatrical appendages
were at last laid aside, because it was
thought to appear improbable, that intrigues,
which usually are to be kept secret,
should be carried on in their presence.</p>

<p>Flutes were played during the whole
time of the performance, and the chief
musician beating time, directed the
actors when they were to raise, and
when they were to depress their voices.
Sometimes one person recited the words,
and another performed the action of the
same part. The tibiæ, or flutes, were
of various kinds: the best account of
the manner in which they were used is
given us by Madame Dacier, as follows:</p>

<p>“The performers played on two
flutes during the whole of the representation.
They stopped the vents of
one of them with the right hand: that
flute was, therefore, called right handed:
the other was stopped with the
left, and called a left-handed flute. In
the first, there were but a few holes;
which occasioned it to give a deep,
bass sound: in the other, the holes
were very numerous: this flute sounded
a sharp shrill note.</p>

<p>“When a comedy was accompanied
by two flutes of a different sound, it
was said to be played <em>Tibiis imparibus
dextris et sinistris, unequal flutes, right
and left handed</em>. When the flutes were
of the same sound, it was said to be
played <em>Tibiis paribus dextris, with equal
right-handed flutes</em>, if they were of a
deep sound: and <em>Tibiis paribus sinistris,
with equal left-handed flutes</em>, when they
were of a sharp shrill sound. The
right-handed flutes were called Lydian;
the left-handed Tyrian; the unequal
Phrygian; as were also the crooked
flutes.”</p>

<p>The tragic and comic actors were
distinguished from each other by the
covering of their feet. The tragedians
wore a sort of boot, called cothurnus,
with a very high heel; which was intended
to give them a commanding,
majestic appearance. The comedians
wore a light shoe, or slipper, called
soccus.</p>

<p>The Romans appear to have been
very partial to dramatic entertainments.
Magistrates were appointed
to exhibit them: and the people
even devoted to the theatre part of
that time which is usually allotted
to more weighty concerns: as their
plays were usually performed in the
day-time. Magnificent theatres were
erected at the public expense; and
sometimes even by private individuals.
A description of one of these buildings
is recorded by Pliny. The scenes were
divided into three partitions, one above
another. The first consisted of one
hundred and twenty marble pillars;
the second of the same number of pillars,
most curiously covered and ornamented
with glass: the third of the
same number of pillars, covered with
gilded tablets. Three thousand brazen
statues filled up the spaces between
the pillars. This theatre would contain
eighty thousand persons. Independently
of the ordinary representations,
plays were performed on all
solemn occasions: at the public feasts
and games, and at the funerals of eminent
citizens. No opportunity seems
to have been neglected to introduce
this species of amusement at Rome:
no nation, ancient or modern, appears
to have cultivated the drama with
greater diligence than the Romans;
and few have had more success. It
is our misfortune, that so few specimens
of the excellence of their dramatists
have descended to our times.
Let us, however, admire and profit by
what we have. The writings of Terence
and of Plautus present us with
an inexhaustible source of pleasure and
instruction. As long as virtuous and
humane sentiments do not lose their
appeal to the heart; as long as purity,
delicacy of expression, wit, and spirit,
and well-wrought fable continue to
satisfy the judgment; so long the names
of Terence and of Plautus must remain
immortal.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="strong larger">P</span>ublius Terentius</span><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#note_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, born at Carthage, in
Africa, was slave to Terentius Lucanus, a Roman
senator: who, justly appreciating his great
abilities, gave him not only a polite education,
but also his liberty in the earlier part of his
life. He is supposed by some to have been
made a prisoner of war: but Fenestella<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#note_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> refutes
this opinion; as <a id="FNanchor_4" href="#note_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>Terence was born after
the conclusion of the second Punic war, and
died before the commencement of the third:
neither, if he had been made a captive by the
<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#note_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>Numidians, or Getulians, could he have fallen
into the hands of the Romans, as there was no
commerce between the Italians and Africans,
before the destruction of Carthage.</p>

<p>Terence lived in the closest intimacy with
many of the Roman nobility, but particularly
with Scipio Africanus<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#note_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Caius Lælius<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#note_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, who
were about his own age<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#note_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, though Fenestella
makes Terence rather older than either of them.
Portius<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#note_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> commemorates their friendship in the
following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum lasciviam nobilium; et fucosas laudes petit:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum Africani vocem divinam inhiat avidis auribus:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Dum se amari ab hisce credit, crebro in Albanum rapi</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ob florem ætatis suæ, ipsus sublatis rebus ad summam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inopiam redactus est.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Itaque e conspectu omnium abiit in Græciam in terram ultimam.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mortuus est in Stymphalo Arcadiæ oppido: nihil Publius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scipio profuit, nihil ei Lælius, nihil Furius;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conductitiam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saltem ut esset, quo referret obitum domini servulus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“While Terence joins in the pleasures of the
nobles, and seeks their empty praise; while he
listens with delight to the divine voice of Africanus;
and thinks himself most happy to sup
with Lælius and with Furius<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#note_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; while he believes
them to be his true friends; while he is
frequently carried to the <a id="FNanchor_11" href="#note_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>Albanian villa; his
property is spent, and he himself reduced to
the greatest poverty: on which account he
goes, avoiding all mankind, to the most distant
parts of Greece, and dies at Stymphalus<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#note_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, a
town in Arcadia: his three great friends Scipio,
Lælius, and Furius, give him no assistance;
nor even enable him to hire a house; that
there might, at least, be a place where his
slave might announce to Rome his master’s
death.”</p>

<p>He wrote six comedies: when the first of them,
the Andrian, was presented to the Ædiles<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#note_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>;
he was desired to read it to Cærius<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#note_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; he accordingly
repaired to his house, and found him
at supper; and, being meanly dressed, was
seated on a stool near the couch of Cærius<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#note_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
where he commenced the reading of his play;
but Cærius had no sooner heard the first few
lines than he invited the poet to sup with him;
after which, the play was read, to the great admiration
of Cærius, who betowed on the author
the most unbounded applause. The other five
comedies met with equal commendation from
the Romans, though Volcatius<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#note_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, in his enumeration
of them, says,</p>

<p class="center small">Sumetur Hecyra sexta ex his fabula.</p>

<p>The Step-mother is reckoned the last of the
six.</p>

<p>The Eunuch was acted twice in one day<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#note_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>;
and the author received for it a higher price
than was ever paid for any comedy before that
time, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, eight thousand sesterces<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#note_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>: on account
of the magnitude of the sum, it is mentioned
in the title of that play. Varro<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#note_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> even
prefers the opening scenes of the Brothers of
Terence to the same part in Menander. The
report that Terence was indebted to Scipio and
Lælius, with whom he was so intimate, for
parts of his comedies, is well known; and he
himself scarcely seems to have discouraged the
assertion, as he never seriously denies it: witness
the Prologue to the Brothers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli, homines nobiles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eum adjutare, assidueque una scribere:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quod illi maledictum vehemens existimant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, cum illis placet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui vobis universis, et populo placent:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And as for what those malicious railers say<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#note_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,
who assert that certain noble persons assist the
poet, and very frequently write with him, what
they think a reproach, he considers as the highest
praise; that he should be thought to please
those who please you, and all Rome; those
who have assisted every one in war, and peace,
and even in their private affairs, with the greatest
services; and yet have been always free from
arrogance.” It is likely, that he might wish, in
some measure, to encourage this idea, because
he knew that it would not be displeasing to
Scipio and Lælius: however, the opinion has
gained ground, and is strongly entertained even
to the present day. Quintus Memmius<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#note_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, in an
oration in his own defence, says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Publius Africanus, qui a Terentio personam
mutuatus, quæ domi luserat ipse, nomine illius
in scenam <span class="lock">detulit.——</span></p>

<p>“Publius Africanus, who borrowed the name
of Terence for those plays which he composed
at home for his <span class="lock">diversion.——”</span></p>
</div>

<p>Cornelius Nepos<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#note_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> asserts, that he has it
from the very first authority, that Caius Lælius
being at his country-house at <a id="FNanchor_23" href="#note_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>Puteoli, on the
first of March<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#note_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, and being called to supper by
his wife at an earlier hour than usual, requested
that he might not be interrupted; and afterwards
coming to table very late, he declared
that he had scarcely ever succeeded better in
composition than at that time; and, being
asked to repeat the verses, he read the following
from the Self-tormentor, Act IV, Scene <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Decem minas quas mihi dare pollicitus est, quod si is nunc me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deceperit, sæpe obsecrans me, ut veniam, frustra veniet:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aut, cum venturam dixero, et constituero, cum is certe</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Decipiam, ac non veniam; Syrus mihi tergo pænas pendet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Truly this Syrus has coaxed me hither, impertinently
enough, with his fine promises that
I should receive ten minæ; but, if he deceives
me this time, ’twill be to no purpose to ask me
to come again; or, if I promise, and appoint
to come, I’ll take good care to disappoint him.
Clitipho, who will be full of eager hope to see
me, will I deceive, and will not come; and
Syrus’ back shall pay the penalty.”</p>

<p>Santra<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#note_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> thinks, that if Terence had required
any assistance in his comedies; he would not
have requested it from Scipio and Lælius, who
were then extremely young<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#note_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; but from <a id="FNanchor_27" href="#note_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>Caius
Sulpicius Gallus, a man of great learning, who
also was the first person who procured<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#note_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the
representation of comedies at the consular
games or from <a id="FNanchor_29" href="#note_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>Quintus Fabius Labeo; or
from<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#note_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Marcus Popilius Lænas, two eminent
poets, and persons<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#note_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of consular dignity: and
Terence himself, speaking of those who were
reported to have assisted him, does not mention
them as young men, but as persons of weight
and experience, who had served the Romans in
peace, in war, and in private business.</p>

<p>After the publication of his six comedies, he
quitted Rome, in the thirty-fifth year of his age,
and returned no more. Some suppose that he
undertook this journey with a view to silence
the reports of his receiving assistance from
others in the composition of his plays: others,
that he went with a design to inform himself
more perfectly of the manners and customs of
Greece.</p>

<p>Volcatius speaks of his death as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sed ut Afer sex populo edidit comœdias</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iter hinc in Asiam fecit: navim cum semel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conscendit, visus nunquam est. Sic vita vacat.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Terence, after having written six comedies,
embarked for Asia, and was seen no more. He
perished at sea.”</p>

<p>Quintus Consentius<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#note_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> writes, that he died at
sea, as he was returning from Greece, with one
hundred and eight plays, translated from Menander<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#note_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
Other writers affirm, that he died at
Stymphalus, a town in Arcadia, or in Leucadia<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#note_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>,
in the consulate of<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#note_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Cneus Cornelius
Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, and
that his end was hastened by extreme grief for
the loss of the comedies which he had translated,
and some others which he had composed himself,
and sent before him in a vessel which was
afterwards wrecked.</p>

<p>He is said to have been of a middle stature,
well-shaped, and of a dark complexion. He
left one daughter, who was afterwards married
to <a id="FNanchor_36" href="#note_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>a Roman knight, and bequeathed to her a
garden of <a id="FNanchor_37" href="#note_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>XX jugera, near the Appian Way,
and close to the <a id="FNanchor_38" href="#note_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>Villa Martis: it is therefore
surprising that Portius should write thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">——nihil Publius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scipio profuit, nihil ei Lælius, nihil Furius:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conductitiam:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saltem ut esset, quo referret obitum domini servulus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“His three great friends, Scipio, Lælius, and
Furius, give him no assistance, nor even enable
him to hire a house, that there might at least be
a place where his slave might announce to
Rome his master’s death.”</p>

<p>Afranius<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#note_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> prefers Terence to all the comic
poets, saying, in his Compitalia<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#note_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p class="center">
Terentio non similem dices quempiam.<br>
<br>
“Terence is without an equal.”<br>
</p>

<p>But Volcatius places him not only after
<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#note_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>Nævius, <a id="FNanchor_42" href="#note_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>Plautus, and <a id="FNanchor_43" href="#note_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>Cæcilius, but even
after <a id="FNanchor_44" href="#note_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>Licinius. <a id="FNanchor_45" href="#note_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>Cicero, in his <span lang="el">ΛΕΙΜΩΝ</span>,
writes of Terence thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tu quoque qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conversum, expressumque Latina voce Menandrum</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Quicquid come loquens, ac omnia dulcia dicens.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And thou, also, O Terence, whose pure
style alone could make Menander speak the
Latin tongue, thou, with the sweetest harmony
and grace, hast given him to Rome.”</p>

<p>Also Caius Julius Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#note_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>“And thou, also, O thou half Menander, art

defect have been objected to thee. But, as it
is, thou hast this great defect, and this, O Terence,
I lament.”</p>

<h3>
THE ARGUMENT.<br>
</h3>
</div><!--end chapter head-->

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">There</span> were in Athens two brothers, <span class="smcap">Chremes</span> and
<span class="smcap">Phania</span>. The former making a voyage to Asia,
left his infant daughter, named <span class="smcap">Pasibula</span>, under
the protection of <span class="smcap">Phania</span>; who, to avoid the dangers
of a war which shortly after convulsed the
<span class="smcap">Grecian</span> States, quitted Athens, and embarked
also for <span class="smcap">Asia</span> with the infant <span class="smcap">Pasibula</span>, designing
to rejoin his brother <span class="smcap">Chremes</span>. His vessel being
wrecked off Andros, he was received and hospitably
entertained by an inhabitant of the island,
where he died, bequeathing his niece to his host,
who generously educated her with his own daughter
<span class="smcap">Chrysis</span>; changing her name from <span class="smcap">Pasibula</span> to
<span class="smcap">Glycera</span>. After some years he also died, and
his daughter <span class="smcap">Chrysis</span>, finding herself reduced to
poverty, and avoided by her relations, removed to
Athens, accompanied by her adopted sister <span class="smcap">Glycera</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Pasibula</span>. Here, supported by her industry,
she lived for some months in a virtuous seclusion;
but after that period became acquainted with
several young Athenians of good family, whose visits
she admitted, hoping perhaps to accomplish an advantageous
marriage either for <span class="smcap">Glycera</span> or for herself.
She was seduced by pleasure, and her conduct
from that time became very far from irreproachable.
Meanwhile a young man, named <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span>,
is accidently introduced at her house, sees
<span class="smcap">Glycera</span>, is enamoured of her; she returns his
affections, and they are privately betrothed; a short
time previous to the death of <span class="smcap">Chrysis</span>, which happens
about three years after her removal to Athens.
<span class="smcap">Chremes</span>, whom we left in Asia, returned to
Athens, and became the father of another daughter,
who was called <span class="smcap">Philumena</span>; he had long before
formed a friendship with <span class="smcap">Simo</span>, the father of <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span>.
<span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span> being a youth of great
worth and high reputation, <span class="smcap">Chremes</span> wishes to bestow
on him the hand of his daughter <span class="smcap">Philumena</span>.
Here the play opens. A report of the connexion
between <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span> and <span class="smcap">Glycera</span> reaching the
ears of <span class="smcap">Chremes</span>, he breaks off the marriage. <span class="smcap">Simo</span>
conceals this, and to try the truth of the rumour,
proposes <span class="smcap">Philumena</span> again to his son, and desires
him to wed her instantly. Apprized by his servant
<span class="smcap">Davus</span> of his father’s artful stratagem, <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span>
professes his willingness to marry, thinking by this
measure to disappoint it; but he defeats himself,
for from his ready consent, <span class="smcap">Chremes</span> concludes
the rumour false, and renews the treaty to the great
embarrassment of <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span>, which, with the
artifices <span class="smcap">Davus</span> employs to extricate him, form
the most diverting scenes of the play. However,
when the affairs of <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span> and <span class="smcap">Davus</span> are reduced
to extremity, and a breach between father
and son appears inevitable on account of the marriage
with <span class="smcap">Glycera</span>, and the refusal to accept <span class="smcap">Philumena</span>,
a stranger called <span class="smcap">Crito</span>, most opportunely
arrives from Andros, and discovers <span class="smcap">Glycera</span>
to be <span class="smcap">Pasibula</span>, the daughter of <span class="smcap">Chremes</span>,
who willingly confirms her the wife of <span class="smcap">Pamphilus</span>,

</div>
<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> poet, when first he bent his mind to write,
thought that he undertook no more than to compose
Comedies which should please the people. But he
finds himself not a little deceived; and is compelled
to waste his time in making Prologues; not to narrate
the plot of his play, but to answer the snarling
malice of an older poet<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#note_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. And now, I pray you,
Sirs, observe what they object against our Author:
Menander wrote the <a id="FNanchor_58" href="#note_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>Andrian and Perinthian: he
who knows one of them knows both, their plots are
so very similar; but they are different in dialogue,
and in style. He confesses that whatever seemed
suitable to the Andrian, he borrowed from the
Perinthian, and used as his own: and this, forsooth,
these railers carp at, and argue against him that
Comedies thus mixed are good for nothing. But, in
attempting to shew their wit, they prove their folly:
since, in censuring him, they censure Nævius,
Plautus<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#note_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, Ennius, who have given our author a
precedent for what he has done: and whose careless
ease he would much rather imitate than their obscure
correctness. But henceforth let them be silent, and
cease to rail; or I give them warning, they shall
hear their own faults published. And now deign
to favour the play with your attention; and give
it an impartial hearing, that you may know what
is in future to be expected from the poet, and
whether the Comedies that he may write hereafter,
will be worthy to be accepted, or to be rejected by
you.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></span></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Simo</span>, <span class="smcap">Sosia</span>, <i>and Slaves, carrying Provisions</i>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><i>Simo.</i> <a id="FNanchor_60" href="#note_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>Carry in those things, directly. (<i>Exeunt
Slaves.</i>) Do you come hither Sosia; I
have something to say to you.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> You mean, I suppose, that I should
take care that these provisions are properly drest.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> No; it’s quite another matter.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> In what else can my skill be of any service?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> There is no need of your skill in the
management of the affair I am now engaged in;
all that I require of you is faithfulness and secrecy;
qualities I know you to possess.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> I long to hear your commands.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You well know, Sosia, that from the
time when I first bought you as my slave;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#note_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> even
from your childhood until the present moment;
I have been a just and gentle master: you served
me with a free spirit; and I gave you freedom;
<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#note_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>as the greatest reward in my power to bestow.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> Believe me, Sir, I have not forgotten it.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Nor have you given me any cause to
repent that I did so.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#note_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> I am very glad, Simo, that my past, and
present conduct has been pleasing to you; and I
am grateful for your goodness in receiving my
poor services so favourably: but it pains me to
be thus reminded of the benefits you have conferred
upon me, as it seems to upbraid me with
having forgotten them.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#note_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Pray, Sir, let me request
to know your will at once.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You shall; but first I must inform you
that my son’s marriage, which you expect to
take place, is only a feigned marriage.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> But why do you make use of this deceit?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> <a id="FNanchor_65" href="#note_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>You shall hear every thing from the
beginning; by which means you will learn my
son’s course of life, my intentions, and the part
I wish you to take in this affair. When my son,
Pamphilus, arrived at man’s estate,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#note_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> of course
he was able to live more according to his own inclination:
for, until a man has attained that
age, his disposition does not discover itself, being
kept in check either by his tutor, or by bashfulness,
or by his tender years.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> That is very true.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Most young men attach themselves
chiefly to one particular pursuit; such, for instance,
as breeding horses, keeping hounds, or
frequenting the schools of the philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#note_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
He did not devote himself entirely to any one of
these: but employed a moderate portion of his
time in each; and I was much pleased to see it.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> As well you might, for I think that
every man, in the conduct of his life, should adhere
to this precept, “<span class="smcap">Avoid excess.</span>”</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> This was his way of life; he bore patiently
with every one, accommodated himself to
the tempers of his associates; and fell in with
them in their pursuits; avoided quarrels; and
never arrogantly preferred himself before his companions.
Conduct like this will ensure a man
praise without envy, and gain many friends.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> This was indeed a wise course of life;
for in these times<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#note_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, flattery makes friends; truth,
foes.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Meantime, about three years ago, a
certain woman, exceedingly beautiful, and in the
flower of her age, removed into this neighbourhood;
she came from the Island of Andros<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#note_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>;
being compelled to quit it by her poverty and the
neglect of her relations<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#note_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> I augur no good from this woman of
Andros.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> At first she lived chastely, and penuriously,
and laboured hard, managing with difficulty
to gain a livelihood<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#note_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> with the distaff and
the loom: but soon afterwards several lovers made
their addresses to her<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#note_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; promising to repay her
favours with rich presents; and as we all are naturally
prone to pleasure, and averse to labour,
she was induced to accept their offers; and at
last admitted all her lovers without scruple. It
happened that some of them with much persuasion
prevailed on my son to accompany them to
her house. Aha! thought I, he is caught<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#note_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>: he
is certainly in love with her. In the morning I
watched their pages going to her house and returning;
I called one of them; Hark ye, boy,
prithee tell me who was the favourite of
Chrysis, yesterday? For this was the Andrian’s
name.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> I understand you, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I was answered that it was Phædrus, or
Clinia, or Niceratus; for all these were her lovers
at that time: well, said I, and what did
Pamphilus there! oh! he paid<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#note_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> his share and
supped with the rest. Another day I inquired
and received the same answer; and I was extremely
rejoiced that I could learn nothing to attach
any blame to my son. Then I thought that
I had proved him sufficiently; and that he was a
miracle of chastity:—for he who has to contend
against the example of men of such vicious
inclinations, and can preserve his mind from its
pernicious influence, may very safely be trusted
with the regulation of his own conduct. To increase
my satisfaction, every body joined as if
with one voice in the praise of Pamphilus, every
one extolled his virtues, and my happiness, in
possessing a son endued with so excellent a disposition.
In short, this his high reputation induced
my friend Chremes to come to me of his
own accord, and offer to give his daughter to
Pamphilus with a large dowry<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#note_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. I contracted
<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#note_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>my son, as I was much pleased with the match,
which was to have taken place on this very day.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> And what has happened to prevent it?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You shall hear: within a few days of
this time our neighbour Chrysis died.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> O happy news! I was still fearful of
some mischief from this Andrian.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Upon this occasion my son was continually
at the house with the lovers of Chrysis,
and joined with them in the care of her funeral;
meantime he was sad, and sometimes would even
weep. Still I was pleased with all this; if,
thought I, he is so much concerned at the death
of so slight an acquaintance, how would he be
afflicted at the loss of one whom he himself loved,
or at my death. I attributed every thing to his
humane and affectionate disposition; in short, I
myself, for his sake, attended the funeral, even
yet suspecting nothing.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> Ah! what has happened then?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I will tell you. The corpse is carried
out; we follow: in the mean time, among the
women who were there<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#note_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, I saw one young girl,
with a form <span class="lock">so——</span></p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> Lovely, without doubt.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And with a face, Sosia, so modest, and
so charming, that nothing can surpass it; and as
she appeared more afflicted than the others who
were there, and so pre-eminently beautiful<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#note_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, and
of so noble a carriage, I approach the women
who were following the body<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#note_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, and inquire who
she is: they answer, The sister of the deceased.
Instantly the whole truth burst upon me at once:
hence then, thought I, proceed those tears; this
sister it is, who is the cause of all his affliction.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> How I dread to hear the end of all this!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> In the mean time the procession advances;
we follow, and arrive at the tomb<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#note_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>: the
corpse is placed on the pile<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#note_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, and quickly enveloped
in flames; they weep; while the sister
I was speaking of, rushed forward in an agony of
grief toward the fire; and her imprudence exposed
her to great danger. Then, then it was,
that Pamphilus, half dead with terror, publicly
betrayed the love he had hitherto so well concealed:
he flew to the spot, and throwing his
arms around her with all the tenderness imaginable;
my dearest Glycera, cried he, what are
you about to do? Why do you rush upon destruction?
Upon which she threw herself weeping
upon his bosom in so affectionate a manner, that
it was easy enough to perceive their mutual love.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> How! is this possible!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I returned home, scarcely able to contain
my anger; but yet I had not sufficient cause
to chide Pamphilus openly; as he might have
replied to me, What have I done amiss, my father?
or how have I offended you? of what am
I guilty? I have preserved the life of one who
was going to throw herself into the flames: I
prevented her: this would have been a plausible
excuse.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> You consider this rightly, Sir; for if
he who has helped to save a life is to be blamed
for it; what must be done to him who is guilty
of violence and injustice?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> The next day Chremes came to me,
and complained of being shamefully used, as he
had discovered for a certainty that Pamphilus
had actually married this strange woman<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#note_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. I
positively denied that this was the case, and he as
obstinately insisted on the truth of it: at last I
left him, as he was absolutely resolved to break
off the match.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> Did you not then rebuke Pamphilus?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> No: there was nothing yet so flagrant
as to justify my rebuke.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> How so, Sir, pray explain?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> He might have answered me thus: you
yourself, my father, have fixed the time when
this liberty must cease; and the period is at
hand when I must conform myself to the pleasure
of another: permit me then, I beseech you,
for the short space that remains to me, to live
as my own will prompts me.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> True. What cause of complaint can
you then find against him?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> If he is induced by his love for this
stranger, to refuse to marry Philumena in obedience
to my commands, that offence will lay
him open to my anger; and I am now endeavouring
by means of this feigned marriage, to
find a just cause of complaint against him: and,
at the same time, if that rogue Davus has any
subtle scheme on foot, this will induce him to
bring it forward now, when it can do no harm;
as I believe that rascal will leave no stone unturned
in the affair; though more for the sake of
tormenting me, than with a view to serve or gratify
my son.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> Why do you suspect that?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Why? because of a wicked mind one
can expect nothing but wicked intentions<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#note_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. But
if I catch him at his tricks—However, ’tis in
vain to say more: if it appear, as I trust it will,
that my son makes no objection to the marriage,
I have only to gain Chremes, whom I must prevail
upon by entreaty; and I have great hopes
that I shall accomplish it. What I wish you to
do is, to assist me in giving out this marriage for
truth, to terrify Davus, and to watch the conduct
of my son, what he does; and what course
he and his hopeful servant resolve upon.</p>

<p><i>Sosia.</i> It is enough, Sir; I will take care to
obey you. Now, I suppose, we may go in.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Go, I will follow presently<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#note_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> My son, I have no doubt, will refuse
to marry; for I observed that Davus seemed
terribly perplexed just now, when he heard that
the match was to take place: but here he
comes<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#note_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>not seeing Simo.</i>) I wondered that
this affair seemed likely to pass off so easily!
and always mistrusted the drift of my old master’s
extraordinary patience and gentleness; who,
though he was refused the wife he wished for, for
his son, never mentioned a word of it to us, or
seemed to take any thing amiss.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> (<i>aside</i>.) But now he will, as you shall
feel, rascal.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> His design was to entrap us while we
were indulging in an ill-founded joy, and fancied
ourselves quite secure. He wished to take advantage
of our heedlessness, and make up the
match before we could prevent him: what a
crafty old fellow!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> How this rascal prates<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#note_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Here is my master! he has overheard
me! I never saw him!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Davus.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Who calls Davus?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Come hither, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) What can he want with
me?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What were you saying?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> About what, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> About what, Sir? The world says that
my son has an intrigue.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Oh! Sir, the world cares a great deal
about that, no doubt.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Are you attending to this, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Yes, Sir, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> It does not become me to inquire too
strictly into the truth of these reports. I shall
not concern myself in what he has done hitherto;
for as long as circumstances allowed of it, I left
him to himself: but it is now high time that he
should alter and lead a new life. Therefore,
Davus, I command, and even entreat, that you
will prevail on him to amend his conduct.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What is the meaning of all this discourse?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Those who have love intrigues on their
hands are generally very averse to marriage.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> So I have heard.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And if any of them manage such an
affair after the counsel of a knave, ’tis a hundred
to one but the rogue will take advantage of their
weakness, and lead them a step further, from
being love-sick to some still greater scrape or
imprudence.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Truly, Sir, I don’t understand what
you said last.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> No! not understand it!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> No. I am not Œdipus<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#note_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but Davus.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Then you wish that what I have to say
should be explained openly and without reserve.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Certainly I do.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Then, sirrah, if I discover that you endeavour
to prevent my son’s marriage by any of
your crafty tricks; or interfere in this business
to show your cunning; you may rely on receiving
a few scores of lashes, and a situation in the
grinding-house<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#note_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> for life: upon this token, moreover,
that when I liberate you from thence, I
will grind in your stead. Is this plain enough
for you, or don’t you understand yet?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Oh, perfectly! you come to the point
at once: you don’t use much circumlocution,
i’faith.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Remember! In this affair above all
others, if you begin plotting, I will never forgive
it.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Softly, worthy Sir, softly, good words
I beg of you.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> So! you are merry upon it, are you,
but I am not to be imposed upon. I advise you,
finally, to take care what you do: you cannot say
you have not had fair warning.</p>

</p>

<p>In truth, friend Davus, from what I have
just heard from the old man about the marriage,
I think thou hast no time to lose. This affair
must be <a id="FNanchor_90" href="#note_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>handled dexterously, or either my
young master or I must be quite undone. Nor
have I yet resolved which side to take; whether
I shall assist Pamphilus, or obey his father. If
I abandon the son, I fear his happiness will be
destroyed: if I help him, I dread the threats of
the old man, who is as crafty as a fox. First,
he has discovered his son’s intrigue, and keeps a
jealous eye upon me, lest I should set some
scheme a-foot to retard the marriage. If he
finds out the least thing, I am undone<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#note_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, for
right or wrong, if he once takes the whim into
his head, he will soon find a pretence for sending
me to grind in the mill for my life; and, to
crown our disasters, this Andrian, Pamphilus’s
wife or mistress, I know not which, is with
child by him: ’tis strange enough to hear their
presumption. I think their <a id="FNanchor_92" href="#note_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>intentions savour
more of madness than of any thing else: boy
or girl, say they, the child shall be brought
up<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#note_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. They have made up among them too,
some story or other, to prove that she is a citizen
of Athens<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#note_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. Thus runs the tale. Once
upon a time there was a certain old merchant<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#note_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>,
who was shipwrecked upon the island of Andros,
where he afterwards died, and the father of
Chrysis took in his helpless little orphan, who
was this very Glycera. Fables! for my part I
don’t believe a word of it: however, they themselves
are vastly pleased with the story. But
here comes her maid Mysis. Well, I’ll betake
myself to the Forum<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#note_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, and look for Pamphilus:
lest his father should surprise him with this marriage
before I can tell him any thing of the matter.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> By the faith of gods and men, if ever

man as I am? Heavens and earth! will this persecution
never end? Shall I never hear the last of
this detested marriage? How have I been insulted;
how have I been slighted! First of all, the match is
agreed on, every thing is prepared, then I am rejected,
now I am courted again. I cannot, for the
soul of me, discover the reason of all this; however,
I shrewdly suspect that this daughter of
Chremes is either hideously <a id="FNanchor_103" href="#note_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>ugly, or that something
is amiss in her; and so, because he can find no
one else to take her off his hands, he comes to me.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) Bless me! I’m almost frightened
out of my senses.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> But what shall I say of my father’s behaviour?
Ought an affair of such consequence
to be treated so lightly? Meeting me just now
in the Forum, Pamphilus, said he, you are to
be married to-day, get ready, make haste home;
it seemed as if he said, go quickly and hang
yourself. I stood amazed and motionless; not
one single word could I pronounce; not one
single excuse could I make, though it had
been ever so absurd, false, or unreasonable:
I was quite speechless. If any one were to
ask me now, what I would have done, if I had
known of this before? I answer, I would have
done any thing in the world to prevent this
hateful marriage; but now what course can I
take? A thousand cares distract my mind. On
one side, I am called upon by love and my compassion
for this unfortunate: on the other by
their continued importunities for my marriage
with Philumena, and a fear of offending my
father, who has been hitherto so indulgent to
me, and complied with my every wish; and
can I now oppose his will? Alas! I am still
wavering; I can resolve upon nothing.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Unhappy wretch that I am. I dread
how this wavering may end at last; but now it
is of the utmost consequence either that I
should say something to him respecting my
mistress, or that he should see her himself; for
the least thing in the world may turn the scale,
while the mind is in suspense.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Whose voice is that? Oh, Mysis, welcome.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Oh! Sir, well met.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> How is your mistress?</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Do you not know? she is in labour<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#note_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>,
and her anguish is increased tenfold at the
thought of this being the day formerly appointed
for your marriage. Her greatest fear is lest you
should forsake her.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Heavens! could I have the heart even
to think of so base an action? Can I deceive
an unfortunate who has intrusted her all to me?
and whom I have always tenderly loved as my
wife? Can I suffer that she, who has been
brought up in the paths of modesty and virtue,
should be exposed to want; <a id="FNanchor_105" href="#note_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>and perhaps even
to dishonour? I never can, I never will permit
it!</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Ah! Sir, if you were your own master,
I should fear nothing; but I dread lest you
should not be able to withstand your father’s
commands.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Do you then think me so cowardly, so
ungrateful too, so inhuman, and so cruel, that neither
our intimate connexion, nor love, nor even
shame can prevail upon me, or influence me to
keep my promise?</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> I am sure of this; she does not deserve
that you should forget her.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Forget her! O Mysis, Mysis, the last
words that Chrysis spoke to me, are still engraved
upon my heart, already at the point of death; she
calls for me; I approach; you all retire: we are
alone with her: she speaks thus,—My dear Pamphilus;
you see the youth and beauty of this dear
girl; I need not tell you how little these endowments
are calculated to secure either her property
or her honour; I call upon you then, by
the pledge of this hand you now extend to me,
and by the natural goodness of your disposition<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#note_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>;
by your plighted faith, and by her helpless situation,
I conjure you not to forsake her. If ever
I have loved you as my brother, if ever she has
obeyed you as her husband, take her, I implore
you, as your wife; be to her a <a id="FNanchor_107" href="#note_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>friend, a guardian,
a parent; to you I confide our little wealth;
in your honour I put all my trust.—She placed
the hand of Glycera in mine, and expired. I received
the precious gift, and never will I relinquish
it.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Heaven forbid you ever should!</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> But why are you abroad at this time?</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> I am going for the midwife.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Make haste then; and Mysis, do you
hear; say not a word to your mistress about this
marriage, lest that should increase her sufferings.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> I understand you, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What is it you tell me, Byrrhia; is she
then to be married to Pamphilus; and is the wedding
to take place even on this very day?</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> It is even so, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> How do you know it?</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> From Davus, whom I met just now in
the Forum.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Alas! the measure of my wretchedness
is now full: my soul has hitherto fluctuated between
my hopes and fears; but now all hope is
lost, I sink wearied and care-worn into utter despair.</p>

<p><i>Byrr</i><a id="FNanchor_109" href="#note_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. I beseech you, O Charinus, <a id="FNanchor_110" href="#note_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>to
wish for something possible, since what you now
wish for is impossible!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I can wish for nothing but Philumena!</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> Ah! how much wiser you would be, if
instead of talking thus, which only serves to nourish
<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#note_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>a hopeless passion; you would endeavour
to subdue, and banish it entirely from your
heart.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> How readily do those who are in health
give good counsel to the diseased! if you were
in my situation you would not talk thus.</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> Well, well, as you please, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> But I see Pamphilus coming this way.
I am resolved to attempt every thing before I
am quite undone.</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> What is he going about now?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I will entreat even my rival himself, I
will implore him, I will tell him of my love. I
trust I shall be able to prevail upon him, at least
to postpone his marriage for a few days; meantime
I hope something may happen in my favour.</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> That something is nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What think you, Byrrhia; shall I speak
to him?</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> Why not? that even if you can obtain
nothing, you may make him think, at least, that
Philumena will find a pressing gallant in you, if
he marries her<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#note_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Get away, rascal, with your base suspicions.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Ha! Charinus, I hope you are well, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Oh, Pamphilus!——I come to implore
from you hope, safety, counsel, and assistance.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Truly, I myself have need of counsel,
and assistance too: but what is this affair?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You are to be married to-day!</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Ay, they say so.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> If you are, Pamphilus, you see me to-day
for the last time<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#note_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Alas! I dread to speak it! tell him,
Byrrhia, I beseech you.</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What is it, speak?</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> My master loves Philumena to distraction,
and hears that she is betrothed to you.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Truly, he and I are not of the same
mind then; but prithee now, Charinus, tell me, has
nothing passed between you and Philumena?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Ah! Pamphilus, nothing.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I wish with all my soul there had!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I implore you then, by all the ties of
friendship, and tried affection, never to wed her:
this is my first request.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Never! if I can help it, believe me.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> But if you cannot grant me this, and
earnestly desire the <span class="lock">match——</span></p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I desire it!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> At least defer it for a day or two, that I
may go from here, and avoid the misery of being
obliged to witness it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Listen to me, Charinus; I think it is
by no means the part of a man of honour to
claim thanks, where none are due to him. I am
more desirous to avoid Philumena, than you are
to obtain her.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> My dearest friend! your words have
given me new life.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Now, if either you, or Byrrhia here, can
do any thing; for <a id="FNanchor_114" href="#note_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>Heaven’s sake do it; contrive,
invent, and manage if you can, that she may
be given to you; I meantime will do all in my
power to prevent her from being given to me.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I am satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> But here comes Davus, most opportunely;
I rely entirely upon his advice.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> [<i>to Byrrhia.</i>] But as for you, you can
tell me nothing but what I don’t care to hear.
Begone, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Byrr.</i> With all my heart, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Heaven! what a world of good news
do I bring! but, [<i>to himself</i>,] where shall I find
Pamphilus? that I may relieve him from his present
fears, and fill his soul with joy.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> He seems to be very much pleased at
something; he’s mighty merry.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh! ’tis nothing at all: he does not yet
know of this unfortunate affair.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> [<i>to himself.</i>] For if he has heard that
he is to be married to-day.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Do you hear what he says?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I’ll be bound he’s at this very moment
half distracted, and seeking for me all over the
town: but where shall I find him, or which way
shall I now direct my course.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Why do you not speak to him?</p>

<p><i>Davus</i> [<i>going.</i>] Well, I’ll go.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Stop, Davus.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Who calls me? Oh! Pamphilus! I
was seeking for you every where. Charinus, too!
well met, Sir; I wanted both of you.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh Davus, I am quite undone.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> But hear me.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I am quite ruined!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I know all your fears.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And as for me, my very existence is at
stake!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I know your affair also<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#note_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> A marriage is——</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I know that also.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> This very day too.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> You stun me; I tell you I know every
thing already. You, Pamphilus, fear lest you
should be compelled to marry Philumena; and
you, Charinus, lest you should not marry her.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Exactly so.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> ’Tis the very thing.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Then, Sir, in that very thing there is
no danger at all; take my word for it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> For heaven’s sake, Davus, if you can
do so, rid me of my fears at once.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I banish them all; Chremes does not
intend to give you his daughter at present.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> How do you know that?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I am sure of it. Your father took me
aside just now, and told me that he meant to have
you married to-day; and added a great deal more,
which I have not time to tell you at present. Immediately
I run at full speed to the Forum, to
look for you; that I may acquaint you with all
this. Not being able to find you, I get upon an
eminence, look around; you are no where to be
seen. By chance I descry among the crowd,
Charinus’ servant Byrrhia; I inquire of him; he
knows nothing of you: how vexatious! quite
perplexed; I begin to consider what course to
take next. Meantime as I was returning and
thinking the business over, a suspicion struck me.
How’s this! thought I; no extra provision made,
the old man gloomy, and the marriage to take
place so suddenly! these things don’t appear
consistent.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Well, what then?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I then go directly to Chremes’ house;
but when I get there, not a soul <a id="FNanchor_116" href="#note_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>do I see before
the door; every thing is quite still and
quiet, <a id="FNanchor_117" href="#note_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>which pleased me not a little.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Very good.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Go on.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I stay there a little while, but no one
goes in or out; I come quite up to the door, and
look in, <a id="FNanchor_118" href="#note_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>but can see no bridemaid; no preparations<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#note_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>;
all was silent.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I understand: a good sign!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Can all these things be consistent with
a marriage?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I think not, Davus.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Think not! do you say? you must be
blind, Sir, not to see it: it is an absolute certainty:
besides all this, as I was returning I
met Chremes’ servant, who was carrying home
some herbs, and as many little <a id="FNanchor_120" href="#note_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>fishes for
the old man’s supper, as might have cost an
obolus.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Friend Davus, you have been my deliverer
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Not at all, Sir, this does not benefit
you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> How so? why Chremes certainly will
not give his daughter to Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Nonsense; as if it followed of course
that he must give her to you, because he does
not give her to him: if you do not take care; if
you do not use all your endeavours, to gain the
support of the old man’s friends, you will be no
nearer your wishes than ever<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#note_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You advise me well; I will go about
it, though in truth this hope has often deceived
me before. Farewell.</p>

</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pamphilus, Davus.</span><br>
</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What then can my father mean? why
does he thus dissemble?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I will tell you, Sir. He knows very
well that it would be unreasonable in him to be
angry with you, because Chremes has refused to
give you his daughter, nor can he take any thing
amiss, before he knows how your mind stands affected
towards the marriage; but if you should
refuse to marry, all the blame will be thrown on
you, and a grievous disturbance created.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What then, shall I bear it patiently,
and consent to marry?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> He is your father, Pamphilus, and it
would not be easy to oppose him: Glycera moreover
is <a id="FNanchor_122" href="#note_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>destitute and friendless, and he would
speedily find some pretext or other to banish her
from the city<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#note_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Banish her.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Ay, directly.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh Davus, what shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Tell him that you are ready to marry.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Can I tell him so?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Never.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Be advised, Sir, tell him so.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Do not attempt to persuade me to it.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Consider the result.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Torn for ever from my Glycera, I
should be wedded to another.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> You are mistaken, Sir, listen to me:
your father, I expect, will speak to you to this
effect. Pamphilus, ’tis my will that you should
be married to-day. I am ready, Sir; you shall
answer: how can he then complain of you? All
his plans on which he places so much reliance
will be rendered abortive, and entirely frustrated
by this reply; which you may very safely make;
as it is beyond a doubt that Chremes will persist
in refusing you his daughter; therefore do not
let the fear of his changing his <a id="FNanchor_124" href="#note_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>mind, prevent
you from following my advice. Tell your father
that you are willing to marry; that when he seeks
a cause of complaint against you, he may not be
able to find any. As to the hopes you indulge,
that no man will give his daughter to you, on account
of this imprudent <a id="FNanchor_125" href="#note_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>connexion that you
have formed; I will soon convince you of their
fallacy; for believe me, your father would rather
see you wedded to poverty itself, than suffer you
to continue your present intimacy with Glycera;
but if he thinks you are indifferent, he will grow
unconcerned, and look out another wife at his
leisure; meantime something may happen in your
favour.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Do you think so?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> There is no doubt of it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Be cautious whither you lead me.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Pray, Sir, say no more about it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I will act as you advise me; but we
must take care that he knows nothing of the
child, for I have promised to bring it up.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> <a id="FNanchor_126" href="#note_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> She entreated me to promise this as a
pledge that I would not forsake her.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Enough. I will be on my guard; but
here comes your father: take care that you do
not appear melancholy or embarrassed.</p>

an harangue with which he expects to embarrass
you: therefore take care to be on your

her charming; in truth, I cannot much blame
Pamphilus, that he had rather wed her himself
than yield her to my master. Well, I’ll carry him

<p><i>Davus.</i> While circumstances allowed him, and
while <a id="FNanchor_133" href="#note_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>his youth in some measure excused him,
I confess he did intrigue a little; but then he
took care to conceal it from the world: he was
cautious, <a id="FNanchor_134" href="#note_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>as a gentleman should be, not to disgrace
himself by giving room for any scandalous
reports; but now as he must marry, he inclines
his thoughts to marriage.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Yet, he appeared to me, to be rather
melancholy<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#note_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Not at all on that account, but he is a
little vexed with you.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> About what?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Oh! a mere trifle.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> But what is it?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Nothing worth speaking of.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> But tell me what it is?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> He says you are too sparing of your
purse.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Who? I?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> You. My father, said he, has scarcely
spent ten drachms for the wedding supper<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#note_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>:
does this look like the marriage of his son? I
cannot invite my companions even on such an
occasion as this. Indeed, Sir<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#note_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, I think you
are too frugal: it is not well timed.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> [<i>angrily.</i>] Hold your tongue.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] I’ve <a id="FNanchor_138" href="#note_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>ruffled him now!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I will take care that every thing is as it
should be. Away! [<i>Exit Davus.</i>] What can
all this be about? what can this crafty knave
mean? if there is any mischief on foot, this fellow
is sure to be the contriver of it.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Indeed, Lesbia, what you say is very
true: one scarcely ever meets with a constant
lover.</p>

<p>[<i>Simo to Davus.</i>] This girl belongs to Glycera!
Ha! Davus?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> But as for Pamphilus——</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] What’s that?</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> He has kept his promise.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] Ha!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] Would to Heaven that he were
deaf, or that she were dumb.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> For girl, or boy, he has given orders
that the child shall be brought up<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#note_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> O Jupiter! what do I hear? it is all
over, if what she says be truth.</p>

<p><i>Lesbia.</i> What you tell me, is a proof of a good
disposition.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> His is most excellent; but now let us
go, lest we should be wanted before we arrive.</p>

<p><i>Lesbia.</i> I follow you.</p>

<p class="pneg right">
[<i>They go in.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> [<i>aside.</i>] Here’s a pretty disaster! how
shall I be able to remedy this evil?</p>

<p>[<i>Simo to himself.</i>] What’s this? Is he so mad?
A foreigner too! <a id="FNanchor_142" href="#note_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>phoo! now I see through it
all! how simple I must be not to discover it at
first.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What does he say he has discovered?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Davus, that indefatigable contriver of
mischief, is the chief mover of all this roguery.
They pretend the birth of a child, that they may
deter Chremes from the match.</p>

<p>[<i>Glycera cries out from the house.</i>] O Juno
Lucina, help! save me! I beseech thee<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#note_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Hey day! what already! ha! ha! ha!
how preposterous! the moment she finds out
that I am within hearing, she begins to cry out.
Why, Davus, your incidents are not well <a id="FNanchor_144" href="#note_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>timed
at all, man.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Mine!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Have your actors forgotten their parts?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I don’t understand you really, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What an object of derision! what a
laughing-stock <a id="FNanchor_145" href="#note_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>would this rascal have made of
me, if he had played off this fine trick in a real
marriage: but now he is shipwrecked whilst I
am safe in port.</p>


<h4 style="display: none; visibility: hidden;">Scene II.</h4>

</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lesbia, Simo, Davus.</span><br>
</p>

<p><i>Lesbia.</i> Hitherto, Archillis, she has all the
usual symptoms of doing well. Now, first,
let her be bathed<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#note_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>: and, after that, give her
the drink, in the quantities I directed. I shall
return immediately. Upon my life, Pamphilus
has got a very pretty boy. Heaven grant he
may live to make a good man! for his father is
a worthy youth, who would not wrong this innocent
young creature.</p>

<p class="p0 right r2">
[<i>Exit.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> (<i>to Davus.</i>) Could any one, who knew
you, doubt for a moment that you were the
contriver of this?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Contriver! of what, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> The midwife never gave her orders
about the treatment of her patient while she was
in the house: but, after she was come out of
doors, she bawls from the street to those within.
O Davus, am I so despised by you? or do I
appear to you a fit subject to practise such
barefaced tricks upon? The least you could
have done, was to have acted cautiously, that I
might, at any rate, seem to be feared, if I had
discovered it.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) By Jupiter, he cheats himself:
I am sure I’ve no hand in it.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Did I not warn you? Did I not threaten
you with the consequences of this? But what
care you? ’Twas all to no purpose! Do you
think that I really believe that Glycera has
borne a child to Pamphilus?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I see his error now, and know my cue.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Why don’t you speak?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What! not believe it! as if you had
not been told of all this before!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I told of it!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Ha! ha! Could you, of yourself,
have discovered that this was all pretended?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I am laughed at!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> You must have been told of it: how
else could you have suspected any thing?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> How! because I know you thoroughly,
sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Meaning, Sir, I suppose, that this
was done by my advice?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Certainly: there can’t be the least
doubt of that.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I’m sorry, Simo, that you don’t yet
know me better.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What! not know you?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> The moment I begin to speak, you
imagine that I am trying to impose upon you.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Quite without cause, hey, Mr. Innocence?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Truly, at this rate, I shall hardly dare
open my <a id="FNanchor_147" href="#note_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>mouth.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> One thing I am sure of; that this
child-birth is all counterfeited.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> You have discovered the truth; but,
<a id="p_51"></a>nevertheless, they will not fail to lay a child at
our door very shortly. I tell you, Sir, beforehand,
that this will happen, that you may be
prepared for it; and not afterwards say, that it
was done by the advice and contrivance of Davus.
Indeed, Sir, I wish to remove the unjust
opinion you entertain of me.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> How do you know this?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I heard it, and believe it to be true.
Many circumstances induce me to form this
conjecture. First of all, this girl affirms that
she is with child by Pamphilus, which I have
discovered to be false. Now, finding that the
marriage preparations are going forward in our
house<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#note_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, she sends her maid to fetch a midwife,
and to provide a child<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#note_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>: at the same time,
thinking that unless they managed that you
should see a child, the marriage would not be
impeded.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> But, as you had discovered all this,
why did you not directly acquaint my son with
their designs?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Why, Sir, who was it that prevailed
on him to break off the connexion? was it not
Davus? We all know how madly he loved her:
but now, on the contrary, he prudently resolves
to marry. In short, Sir, leave this business
to me: and do you persevere, (as you have
begun,) in forwarding the marriage: and, I
trust, that Heaven will be propitious to your
endeavours!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Well, now, go in, and wait for me.</p>


<h4 style="display: none; visibility: hidden;">Scene III.</h4>
<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap larger">Scene</span> <abbr title="Three"><span class="smcap larger">III.</span></abbr>
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Simo.</span><br>
</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I am not exactly inclined to believe
this fellow; and I know not whether all that he
has been telling me is true, neither do I much
care. Pamphilus has given me his promise;
that I conceive to be of the greatest consequence.
Now, I will go to Chremes, and
entreat him to give his daughter to my son. If
I prevail, what can I do better than celebrate the
marriage this very day? As for Pamphilus, if
he refuse, I have no doubt I can compel him to
keep his promise<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#note_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. And, most opportunely
for my purpose, I see Chremes himself coming
this way.</p>


<h4 style="display: none; visibility: hidden;">Scene IV.</h4>
<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap larger">Scene</span> <abbr title="Four"><span class="smcap larger">IV.</span></abbr>
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Simo, Chremes<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#note_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.</span><br>
</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Chremes, I am very glad to see you!</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> O! Simo, I was looking for you.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And I for you.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> I meet you most opportunely. Several
persons came to me, and asserted, that you
had told them, that my daughter was to be
given in marriage to your son to-day. For this
reason, I came to see whether they have lost
their senses, or you your’s.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Hear me, Chremes; and you shall
know, both what you come to ask, and what I
desire of you.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> I am all attention: pray proceed.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I conjure you, by the gods, and by our
friendship, Chremes, which has grown up with
us from our earliest years, and strengthened with
our age: for the sake of your daughter, your
only child: and, for the sake of my son, whose
welfare depends entirely upon you; I entreat
you to assist me in this affair: and renew your
consent to the marriage of our children.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Ah, Simo, what need of prayers? as
if it were necessary to use so much entreaty with
me, your friend. Do you think that I am less
your friend than when I offered my daughter to
your son? If the marriage will conduce to their
mutual happiness, in Heaven’s name, send for
my daughter, and let them marry at once: but,
if it be found, that it would tend to the detriment,
rather than to the advantage, of both; I
beseech you to consult their mutual benefit,
without partiality, as if you were the father of
Philumena, and I of Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Truly, Chremes, it is with that view
that I wish their union, and entreat you to consent
to it. Neither should I press it so earnestly
upon you, if the present aspect of the
affair did not justify my urgency.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> How so, pray?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Glycera and my son have quarrelled!</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Indeed! I hear you.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And the breach between them is so
great, that I trust that we shall be able entirely
to detach Pamphilus from her society.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Fables!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Upon my honour what I tell you is a
fact.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> A fact, by Hercules, that I’ll explain
to you. The quarrels of lovers, is the renewal<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#note_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
of their love.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You are right, and that is the reason of
my request: I am anxious that we should seize
this opportunity to prevent them, while his love
is weakened by her insolence and upbraidings.
Let us then hasten his marriage, before the artifices
and hypocritical tears of these creatures
recal his love-sick mind to pity. And, I trust,
Chremes, that a well-assorted marriage, and the
endearing society of his wife, will enable my
son to extricate himself easily from their toils.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> You may view the affair in that
light: but I cannot think, either that Pamphilus
could be faithful to my daughter, or that I could
bear to see him otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> But how do you know that, without
you put him to the trial.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> But to stake the happiness of my
daughter on that trial, is hard indeed.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Yet the most serious mischief, after all,
can amount but to a separation<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#note_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, which may the
gods avert. But, on the other hand, if he fulfils
our wishes, consider the advantages that will
result from the marriage: in the first place, you
will restore to your friend a son: you will ensure
to yourself, a dutiful son: and, to your daughter,
a faithful husband.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> What occasion for so many words:
if you think this step so very essential to reclaim
your son, I should be sorry to throw any impediment
in your way.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> O Chremes! you well deserve the love
I’ve always borne you.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> But tell me——</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> How did you learn their quarrel?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I was informed of it by Davus himself,
who is the confidant of all their counsels; and
he persuaded me to do all in my power to forward
the marriage: would he have done so, do
you think, had he not known it to be consonant
to my son’s wishes? But you yourself shall hear
what he says. Within, there: send Davus hither;
but here he is, I see him coming forth.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I was coming to you, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Why is not the bride brought? it
grows late<a id="FNanchor_154a" href="#note_154a" class="fnanchor">[154ᴬ]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> (<i>to Chremes.</i>) Do you hear him? I
confess to you, Davus, that, till lately, I have
been fearful, that you would prove perfidious<a id="FNanchor_154b" href="#note_154b" class="fnanchor">[154ᴮ]</a>,
like the common herd of slaves, and deceive me
in this intrigue of Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I do such a thing, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I did suspect it, and, on that very account,
I concealed from you what I will now
disclose.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What is that, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You shall hear: for, at last, I begin
to think that I may trust you.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Ah, Sir, you now appreciate my
character as you ought; you now see what kind
of man I am.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> This marriage was all counterfeited.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Counterfeited!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Yes, for the purpose of proving you
and my son, and to try how you would receive
the proposal.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> How! is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Fact, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I never could have fathomed this design;
what a profound contrivance! deep, Sir,
very deep. (<i>bantering.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> But hear me out. After I sent you in,
I most opportunely met my friend Chremes.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) How! what does he say?
All is lost, I fear.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I related to him what you had just before
related to me.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) What do I hear!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I entreated him to give his daughter to
Pamphilus, and, with great difficulty, prevailed
upon him to consent.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) How unfortunate!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Ha! what’s that you say<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#note_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> How very fortunate, I say.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Chremes now consents to an immediate
union.</p>

<p><a id="p_58"></a><i>Chremes.</i> Well, I will now return home, and
order every thing to be prepared: when all is

embarrassed the son with a marriage he detests;
which I have brought about this very day,

hopeless; and Pamphilus as the greatest evil
that could befal him. O! wise Davus, if you

<p><i>Pam.</i> But I confess that I am justly punished
for my imprudence: for my want of common

to the keeping of such a shallow slave? I only
pay the penalty of my folly: however, the rascal

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) If I escape this time, I think
I never need know fear again.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> And what can I say to my father? Can

<p><i>Davus.</i> Certainly, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What trust can I put in such a rascal<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#note_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>?
Can you remedy a misfortune, which appears
entirely ruinous? Ah! how foolishly I
relied on you, who, out of a perfect calm<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#note_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>,
have raised this storm, and wrecked me on the
rock of this accursed marriage! Did I not forewarn

<p><i>Pam.</i> What do you deserve<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#note_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Death. But allow me a short time
to recover myself, and I will soon consider what

<p><i>Pam.</i> Alas! I have not time to punish you as

not suffer me to revenge myself on you.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_159" href="#note_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>Is this credible, or to be mentioned as a
truth, that any man can be so innately worthless,
as to rejoice at the miseries and misfortunes of
others, and even turn them to his own advantage?
Ah! is it possible that such baseness can
exist? Those men have characters of the very
worst description, who make a scruple to deny
a favour; and are ashamed<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#note_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, or unwilling to
give a downright refusal at first; but who, when
the time arrives for the performance of their
promises, necessarily expose themselves in their

yet, circumstances compel them to give an absolute
denial: and they will afterwards insult
you with the most impertinent speeches, as,
Who are you? What are you to me? Why should
I resign my mistress to you? Every man for himself,
Sir, is my maxim! And, if you upbraid
them with their want of honour, they are not at

</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh! Charinus, unless the gods assist
us, my imprudence has undone both you and
myself!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What! imprudence! So you found an
excuse at last. You have broken your promise,
Sir.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> How! at last?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Do you think that any thing you can
say will impose upon me a second time?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What do you mean, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> As soon as I had told you of my love
for Philumena, she pleased you forsooth! Alas!
fool that I was! I judged of your heart by my
own. I believed you to be sincere, and you deceived
me.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> You deceive yourself.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Did you think that your happiness
would not be complete, unless you could delude
an unfortunate lover by nourishing his vain
hopes? Well, take her<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#note_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I take her! Alas, you know not half
the miseries that oppress me; nor how my rascal
Davus has embarrassed me with his pernicious
advice.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> No wonder! I suppose he follows the
fine example you set him.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> You would not talk thus if you knew
me, or my love.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> (<i>ironically.</i>) Oh! I know every thing:
you have been in high dispute with your father;
and he is now most prodigiously angry with you:
and has been striving, in vain, all this day, to
prevail upon you to wed Philumena.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> To prove how little you know of my
misfortunes, learn, that no marriage was expected
to take place: neither did my father
think of constraining my inclinations.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> O no! ’tis your inclinations that constrain
you.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Hear me: you do not yet <span class="lock">understand——</span></p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I understand but too well that you are
about to wed Philumena.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Why do you vex me thus<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#note_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>? hear me,
I say: he never ceased urging me to tell my
father that I was ready to marry: he prayed, he
entreated, until, at length, I was induced to
comply.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Who did this?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Davus.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Davus?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Davus has marred all.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I know not, unless the gods, in their
anger, decreed that I should follow his pernicious
counsel.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Is this so, Davus?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> It is indeed but too true.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What can you say for yourself, you
rascal? May the gods punish you as you deserve!
Answer me, Slave, I say, if his greatest
enemies had been desirous of entangling him in
this marriage, what worse advice could they
possibly have given him?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I have been deceived, but am not disheartened.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Our last plan was unsuccessful, but
we’ll try another: unless you think that because
the first prospered so indifferently, the evil cannot
be remedied?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh, far otherwise! for <a id="p_67"></a>I have no
doubt, that if that wise head of yours goes to
work, instead of the one wife you have provided
me with already, you’ll find me two.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Pamphilus, I am your slave; and, as
such, it is my duty to exert myself to the utmost
to serve you, to labour for you night and
day, and even to expose my life to peril, to do
you service; but, ’tis your part, if any thing
should happen cross, to pardon me: my endeavours
have been unsuccessful ’tis true; but,
indeed, I did my best; if you can do better,
dismiss me.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Certainly; but first place me in the
situation in which you found me.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> But it must be done directly.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Hist! Glycera’s door opens<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#note_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What can that signify to you?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I’m studying for an expedient.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> How, at last!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> And have no doubt but I shall soon
find one.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> (<i>speaking to Glycera within.</i>) I will
directly, Madam; wherever he may be, I’ll
take care to find your dear <a id="FNanchor_165" href="#note_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>Pamphilus, and
bring him to you: only, my love, let me beg
of you not to make yourself so wretched.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Mysis!</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Who is that? Ah! Pamphilus! you
come most opportunely.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> My mistress conjures you by the love
you bear her, to come to her instantly: she
says, she shall be miserable till she sees you.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Heavens! I’m quite distracted: (<i>to
Davus.</i>) Villain! behold the misery to which
we are reduced: this is your work! she has
heard of the intended marriage, and therefore
sends for me.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> All would have been quiet, if that fellow
had but been quiet.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>to Charinus.</i>) Well done! if he does
not rave enough of himself, do try to make him
worse.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> It is the rumour of your approaching
marriage with Philumena that makes her so miserable.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Mysis, I solemnly swear to you by all
the gods, that I never will forsake her; no,
though my love for her should make all mankind
my foes, I never, never will forsake her. I
wooed, and made her mine; our souls accord;
and I will hold no communion with those who
wish to separate us: death alone shall part us.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Your words revive me, Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> <a id="FNanchor_166" href="#note_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>The oracles of Apollo are not more
true. I wish, that, if it be possible, my father
should not think that I throw any impediments
in the way of the marriage: if not, I will do
what will be easily done, tell him frankly that I
cannot marry Chremes’s daughter. Charinus,
what do you think of me?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> That you are as wretched as I am.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I am studying for an expedient.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> (<i>to Pamphilus.</i>) But you are constant
and courageous<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#note_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> (<i>to Davus.</i>) I know what you would
attempt<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#note_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I will both attempt, and accomplish
it, rest assured, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> But it must be done immediately.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> It shall be done immediately.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> What is your plan?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>to Charinus.</i>) Do not deceive yourself,
Sir; ’tis not for you, but for my master
that I am scheming.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Enough.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> What are you going to do? tell me<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#note_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I am afraid that this day will scarcely
afford me sufficient time for action: I am sure
I have none to waste in talking: let me beg you
both to withdraw from this place: you hinder
me from putting my designs into execution.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I will go to my Glycera.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) I acted wisely in avoiding

<p><i>Davus.</i> What a disgraceful trick! it ought to
be publicly exposed.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> O! impudent fellow!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> ’Tis true: I saw old Canthara, with

<p><i>Mysis.</i> Thank Heaven, that there were some
free women present when my mistress was delivered<a id="FNanchor_179a" href="#note_179a" class="fnanchor">[179ᴬ]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> She knows little of the man she wants
to practise these tricks upon: do you think that
if Chremes saw this child before our door, he
would refuse us his daughter on that account?
I say he would give her more willingly.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) Not he, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> And, to be short with you, that you
may understand me at once, if you don’t take
away the child instantly, I’ll roll him into the

kennel.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> <a id="FNanchor_179b" href="#note_179b" class="fnanchor">[179ᴮ]</a>By Pollux, fellow, you are drunk.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> One falsehood brings on another:

of Athens.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) How!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> And that he will be compelled to
marry her<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#note_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mysis.</i> What then, pray, is she not a citizen?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) By Jupiter, I have narrowly
escaped making myself a common laughing-stock
to all the town.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>turning round suddenly.</i>) Who
speaks there? Oh Chremes! you are come just

when she left the isle of Andros. I should be

to reduce her to poverty.</p>

fulfilled in deed.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Your eagerness to obtain what you
desire makes you unjust, and forgetful of your
usual friendship and consideration; for, if you
reflected for a moment on what you ask of me,
you would cease to urge me to do myself such
an injustice.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What injustice.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Can you ask? you prevailed on me
to choose as my daughter’s husband, a young
man distracted with love for another, and detesting
every thought of marriage: if this union
had been consummated, it would have inthralled
her with a husband who would not have loved
her, and exposed her to all the miseries of an
unhappy union: that, at the expense of her
happiness, I might attempt the cure of your
son. You obtained your request: the treaty
went forward, while circumstances allowed of
it; but now the affair wears a different aspect,
be satisfied, and bear your disappointment with
temper. It is said that Glycera is a citizen of
Athens; <a id="FNanchor_193" href="#note_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>and that she has a son by Pamphilus:
this sets us free.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I conjure you, Chremes, by the gods,
not to suffer yourself to be led away by those
who wish to make their advantage of my son’s
follies: all those reports are invented and spread
abroad, with a view to prevent the marriage:
when their cause ceases, they will cease also.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> You are mistaken: I myself saw
the Andrian’s maid quarrelling with Davus.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Oh, no doubt! that I can easily believe.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> But, in earnest; when neither knew
that I was present.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I believe it: for Davus told me not
long ago that it would be so: and I can’t think
how I could forget to tell you of it, as I intended.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What’s the matter now?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) I never saw any man arrive
more opportunely.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Whom is this rascal <a id="ch1"></a>praising?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) All now is safe.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What hinders me from speaking to
him?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) ’Tis my master, what shall I

<p><i>Simo.</i> (<i>sneering.</i>) God save you, worthy Sir.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Oh! Simo, and our Chremes, all

<p><i>Simo.</i> You’ve taken good care, no doubt!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Send for the bride as soon as you

<p><i>Simo.</i> Very well, but Pamphilus is absent
now: however, do you answer me: what business
had you in that house?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> (<i>confused.</i>) Who? I?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> You.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I, do you say?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Yes, you, I say.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> I went in just now.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> As if I asked him how long it was ago.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> With Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> How! is Pamphilus there? wretch that
I am! I’m half distracted! ha! rascal, did you

<p><i>Davus.</i> So they are.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Why then is he there?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>sneering.</i>) Oh! he’s gone to quarrel
with her, no doubt.</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Oh yes, and Chremes, I will tell
you of a most curious affair. An old man,
whose name I know not, arrived here just now;
he seems both shrewd and confident; his manners
and appearance command respect; there
<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#note_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>is a grave severity in his countenance; and
he speaks with boldness.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What’s all this about, sirrah?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Nothing, truly, but what I heard him say.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And what does he say?</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> That he can prove Glycera to be a
citizen of Athens.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> (<i>in a passion.</i>) Ho! Dromo! Dromo!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Dromo!</p>

<p><i>Davus.</i> Only hear me.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Reproaches! Can any be too severe for

<p><i>Pam.</i> I have heard that she is.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Ah! Pamphilus, is it only now that
you have discovered that? long, long ago, I

were willing to sacrifice every thing to your desires;
then it was that you might truly have
called yourself unhappy. But what am I doing?
why do I torment myself? why should I suffer?
why imbitter my old age with his mad
folly? Am I to pay the penalty of his offences?
No: let him have her: I bid him farewell: let
her supply the place of his father.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh, my father!</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What need have you of a father? you,
who have chosen a wife, children, and home,
which are all of them disagreeable, and even
obnoxious to that father? Persons are suborned
hither too, <a id="FNanchor_198" href="#note_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>who say, that she is a citizen of

<p><i>Pam.</i> Dear Sir, hear me but for a moment.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Do you ask? Can you think that you

them with fair words and fine promises?</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> Are you in your senses?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> And, at last, conclude this shameful
fraud, by marrying them to their mistresses?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> (aside.) I am undone? Crito, I fear,

<p><i>Chremes.</i> <a id="FNanchor_201" href="#note_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>Simo, if you knew this stranger
as well as I do, you would think better of him:
he is a worthy man.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> He a worthy man? but yes, it was
very good of him to be sure to come here so opportunely
on the day of my son’s marriage! he!
who was never at Athens before! Chremes,
ought such a man to be believed?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) I could easily explain that circumstance;
but I fear my interference would
offend my father.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> A sycophant<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#note_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> What!</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Bear with him, Crito, ’tis his humour.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> Then let him look to it: if he persists
in saying all he pleases, I will make him hear
something that will not please him. Do I interfere
in this affair? what have I to do with it?
Can you not bear your disappointment patiently.
As for what I assert, it is easy enough
to ascertain whether it is true or false. Some
years ago, a certain Athenian was shipwrecked,
and cast upon the isle of Andros: he was accompanied
by this very Glycera, who was then
an infant: and, in great distress, applied for assistance
to the father of Chrysis.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Now he begins a tale.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Suffer him to speak.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> What! will he interrupt me?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>to Crito.</i>) Pray proceed.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> Chrysis’ father, who received<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#note_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> him,
was my relation: and, at his house, I’ve heard
that shipwrecked stranger say, that he was an
Athenian: he died in Andros.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> (<i>eagerly.</i>) His name <span class="lock">was ——</span></p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> His name so quickly. Phania.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> At least I think it was Phania: one
thing I am sure of, he said he was from<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#note_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
Rhamnus.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Oh Jupiter!</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> Many other persons who were then in
Andros heard of these things.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Heaven grant my hopes may be fulfilled:
tell me, Crito, did he call the child his
own?</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Whose then?</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> He said she was the daughter of his
brother.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Then she is surely mine!</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> What say you?</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> How can she be yours? What is it
you say?</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Listen, Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> What are your reasons for believing
this?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> That Phania was my brother.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> I know it: I was well acquainted with
him.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> That he might avoid the war, he
quitted Greece: and, following me, set sail
for Asia: fearing to leave the child, he took her
with him: and this is the first account I have
ever received of their fate.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I am scarcely myself: my mind is so
agitated by fear, hope, joy, and astonishment, at
this so great and unexpected happiness.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Believe me, Chremes, I rejoice most
sincerely that Glycera proves to be your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> That, I believe, my father.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> But stay: I have yet one doubt,
which gives me some uneasiness.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Away with all your doubts and scruples;
you seek a difficulty where none exists.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> The name does not agree.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> I know she bore some other name
when an infant.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> What was it? Crito, have you forgotten?</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> I am trying to remember it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Shall I suffer his want of memory to
retard my happiness, when I myself can find a
remedy? I will not. Chremes, the name you
want is Pasibula.</p>

<p><i>Crito.</i> The very name<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#note_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> You are right.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> I have heard it from herself a thousand
times.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> Chremes, I hope you are convinced
how sincerely we all rejoice at this discovery<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#note_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> I have no doubt of it.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> And now, dear Sir.</p>

<p><i>Simo.</i> The happy turn of the affair has reconciled
me, my son: be all unpleasant recollections
banished.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> A thousand thanks, my father. I trust
that Chremes also consents that Glycera should
be mine.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Undoubtedly: with your father’s
approbation.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Oh! that is certain.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#note_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a><i>Simo.</i> I consent most joyfully.</p>

<p><i>Chremes.</i> Pamphilus, my daughter’s portion
is ten talents<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#note_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pam.</i> Dear sir, I am quite satisfied.</p>

remember me.</p>

<i>Caius Suetonius Tranquillus.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The history of the life of Terence is enveloped in
more obscurity than might have been expected, considering
his many eminent qualities, and the times
in which he lived. Suetonius’s account is not very
comprehensive; it is, however, the best which has
reached us, and indeed the only one at all to be depended
on. Caius Suetonius Tranquillus, a correct
and impartial biographer, was secretary to the Emperor
Adrian: and enjoyed the friendship of Pliny
the younger: he flourished about A.D. 115.</p>

<i>Terentius.</i><br>

<p>This appellation was conferred on the poet by his
patron Terentius Lucanus: his true name is unknown,
even conjecture is silent on this subject.
Slaves, who received their freedom, usually bore the
name of the person who manumitted them: sometimes
also, during their slavery, they were called by
the name of their master. Terentius Lucanus does
not appear to have been a person of any particular
note; as he is never mentioned but as the friend and
patron of Terence, to whom he is indebted for rescuing
his name from oblivion.</p>

<p>“Rome could never boast of a more accurate

<p class="hanging"><i>Terence was born after the conclusion of the second
Punic war, and died before the commencement of
the third.</i></p>

<p>The second Punic war ended 201 B.&nbsp;C. in the year
of Rome 553: and the third commenced 150 B.&nbsp;C.
in the year of Rome 604, about three years before
the destruction of Carthage. Terence was born 189
B.&nbsp;C., which was 12 years after the termination of the
second Punic war, and he died at the age of 36,
three years before the beginning of the third Punic
war. If we suppose Terence to have been a freeborn
Carthaginian, it is very difficult to account for
his being a slave at Rome; because the Romans
could not have taken him prisoner in war, as they
were at peace with the Carthaginians during the
whole of his life. Neither is it probable that he was
made a prisoner, and sold to the Romans either by
the Numidians, or by the Gætulians, as his perfect
knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, at
twenty-five years of age, is a most forcible reason
for believing that he was removed to Rome in extreme
youth: long before he could have been able
to undergo the fatigue attendant on a military life.
I can solve this difficulty in no other way than by
supposing, either that the parents of Terence were
themselves slaves at Carthage, and consequently he
also was the property of their master; (as the children
of slaves shared the fate of their parents;) or
that he was sold to the Carthaginians by the Numidians,
or by the Gætulians. In either of these
cases, it is by no means improbable that during the
peace which followed the second Punic war, Terence
might in his infancy have been sold by his Carthaginian
master to one of those Romans who visited
Carthage during the peace.</p>

<i>The Numidians or Gætulians.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Numidia and Gætulia, or Getulia, at the time of
Terence’s birth, formed a part of the dominions of
the celebrated African prince Masinissa, who so
eminently distinguished himself as the firm and
faithful ally of the Roman Republic: and as the
formidable enemy of the Carthaginians. Numidia
was situated S.W. of the territories of Carthage;
and is now that part of Southern Barbary, known by
the name of Biledulgerid. Gætulia (the boundaries
of which were afterwards regulated by Marius) was
a most extensive country, and lay S.W. of Numidia:
it is now very little known, and reaches from the
south of Barbary, or the country of Dates, across
the Great Desert or Sahara, almost as far south as
the river Niger. It may be conjectured that the northern
region only of this vast country was subject
to the control of King Masinissa.</p>

<i>Scipio Africanus.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Publius Cornelius Scipio Æmilianus Africanus
Numantinus was the son of Paulus Æmilius, whose
conquest of Macedonia procured him the title of
Macedonicus. The young Æmilius was adopted
(during the life of his father) by the son of the conqueror
of Hannibal, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus,
whose name he afterwards bore (in conformity
with the established custom): and it is not a
little remarkable, that the appellation of Africanus
which the son of Æmilius then acquired by adoption,
he afterwards claimed in his own right, as the
destroyer of Carthage. The title of Numantinus
was conferred on this hero, as a tribute to his valour
and conduct in the war against the inhabitants of
Numantia, who were totally destroyed with their
city, after a long and desperate resistance. Scipio
was born in the year of Rome 569, and died in the
year 624. Some persons have been misled by a singular
coincidence of circumstances relative to the
two Scipios, into a belief that it was the elder of the
two who honoured Terence with his friendship. The
error is evident, as the death of the first Scipio Africanus
took place before Terence was ten years of
age. The elder Scipio honoured with his particular
regard Caius Lælius, who obtained the consulship in
the year of Rome 563: the connexion between them
was cemented by the strict ties of a virtuous friendship.
It is a circumstance worthy of remark, that
the chosen intimate of the younger Africanus was
also called Caius Lælius.</p>

</p>

<p>Caius Lælius, whose virtues procured him the appellation
of Sapiens, or the Wise, is supposed to
have been the son of the Lælius who enjoyed the
friendship of the elder Scipio. Caius Lælius Sapiens
was the senior Consul or Consul Prior in the year of
Rome 613. Cicero’s treatise “De Amicitiâ,” in
which he represents Lælius discoursing on the nature
and delights of a pure and delicate friendship,
is a monument of the attachment of Scipio and
Lælius, worthy of them and of himself.</p>

where Scipio, Lælius, or Furius probably possessed
a villa, was in the immediate vicinity of Alba Longa.

must be considered as an insurmountable objection
to it, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>—The Gens Acilia (of which Acilius was
a member) was <em>a plebeian family</em>: consequently,
Acilius must have been a plebeian Ædile, whereas
the inspection of the Roman plays was the office of

<i>The Couch of Cærius.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Cœna of the Romans (their principal meal)
was usually taken at three o’clock in the afternoon:
when they partook of it, instead of sitting in the modern
manner, they reclined on couches which were
placed round the table in the form of the letter C; a
space was left unoccupied that the slaves in placing
and removing the dishes might not incommode the
guests. The number of the couches was generally
limited to three; each of which was occupied sometimes
by four, but usually by only three persons. The
body was raised, and supported by the left arm; the
feet of him who reclined at the upper end of the
couch lay at the back of the person next him:
(though prevented from touching his clothes by
cushions placed between them) and the feet of the
second at the back of the third. To place more
than three guests on one couch was accounted both
mean and vulgar. Cicero notices this in his oration
against Piso, “<i lang="la">Græci stipati, quini in lectulis, sæpe
plures</i>,” speaking of “<span class="translation">five, and often a greater number
crowded together on one small couch</span>.” The Romans
indulged themselves with couches only at
supper: no ceremony was observed at their other
meals, which were taken sitting or standing, alone
or in company, as inclination prompted. In the
earlier ages both Romans and Greeks sat upright at
their meals: Homer expressly mentions (<cite>in <abbr title="Odyssey">Odyss.</abbr>
<abbr title="Book">B.</abbr> 10.</cite>) <span lang="el">“ἥμεθα δαινύμενοι,”</span> “<span class="translation">we sat feasting</span>;” also

<p>This circumstance is so much the more extraordinary,
as a play was seldom exhibited on the Roman

then, must the Eunuch have been received,
when the audience with the loudest acclamations,
called for a second representation of this admirable
comedy on the same day! It is necessary to explain
that the actors had sufficient time to repeat their
performance, as dramatic entertainments were
usually frequented by the Romans, not in the evening
as among the moderns, but in the course of the
day, and generally previous to the hour of their

and his colleague, inadequate to suppress the insurrection
of Spartacus, whose successes at the head
of the rebellious gladiators, alarmed all Rome. The
military occupations of Varro did not prevent his
close attention to literature: his writings were very
voluminous; and those of them which remain are
deservedly in high estimation.</p>

<i>And as for what those malicious railers say, who assert
that certain noble persons assist the poet.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The chief of those railers, and the arch-enemy of
Terence, was the Luscius Lanuvinus to whom Volcatius
in his list of poets assigns the ninth place;—and
the same person whom Donatus designates by
the name of Lucius Lavinius. Luscius was not
singular in this imputation against our author.
Valgius and others seem to consider Terence but
the mere nominal author of the six pieces which
bear his name. That Scipio and Lælius assisted
him with their advice, is highly probable, and his
vanity might feel flattered by the insertion among
his own writings, of short passages of their composition;
but when we call to mind, that Africanus
and his friend, two persons of the most refined delicacy
and taste, distinguished by their friendship,
and selected as a companion in their hours of retirement
and relaxation, a freedman! a man whose rank
was infinitely inferior to their own; we must naturally
suppose that those eminent persons courted the
society of Terence, as admirers of his extraordinary
genius, and elevation of sentiment. As they could
not have become thoroughly acquainted with our author’s
engaging qualifications, but from his dramatic
compositions, it is most probable that the <span class="smcap">Andrian</span>
at least, was published, before he was honoured
with the intimacy of either Scipio, Lælius,
or Furius. Indeed there can be but little doubt
that the success of this play, (which he wrote when
he was too little known, perhaps, to receive assistance
from any one,) was the means of drawing him
from the obscurity of his low rank, and of obtaining
the notice and approbation of the great men of his
age, and their patronage for his future productions.</p>

<i>He would not have requested it from Scipio and
Lælius, who were then extremely young.</i></p>

<p>Santra’s argument is of no force: for when
Terence published the Andrian, in the year of Rome
587, at twenty-seven years of age, Scipio was
eighteen, and might, at that age, have been perfectly
capable of assisting Terence; for, independent
of his excellent education, on which his
father had bestowed infinite care and pains, he was
possessed of a very superior genius: and nature
had united in him all the fine qualities of his father,
and of his grandfather by adoption, Scipio the Great.
Velleius Paterculus wrote his eulogium as follows,
“<cite>Publius Scipio Æmilianus inherited the virtues of
his grandfather Publius Africanus, and of his father
Lucius Paulus, excelled all his cotemporaries in
wit and learning, and in all the arts of war and
peace; and, in the course of his whole life never did,
said, or thought, any thing, but what was worthy of
the highest praise</cite>.”</p>

<p>“We have seen princes in France, who, at the age
of eighteen, were capable of assisting a poet, as
well with respect to the conduct and arrangement of
his subject; as in what related to the manners,
the diction, and the thoughts. Menander published
his first piece at twenty years of age. It is
clear, then, that there have been persons of eighteen,
capable of assisting a poet. It appears, moreover,
that the enemies of Terence did not publish this
imputation against him till the latter years of his
life, for the poet complains of it only in the prologues
to the Self-tormentor and the Brothers: the
first of which was played three years, and the last
but one year before his death. When the first appeared,
he was thirty-one, and Scipio twenty-two:
and when the last was published, he was thirty-four,
and Scipio was twenty-five.”—<span class="smcap">Madame

<i>Who procured the representation of comedies at the
Consular Games.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Ludi Consulares and Ludi Consuales were
probably the same, as we have no account of the
institution of any games particularly in honour of
the Consuls, to be celebrated either at their entering
on, or resigning their office; for the <i>Latinæ
Feriæ</i>, though superintended particularly by the
Consuls, and a part of their office, were not called
Consular Games. The Consual, or Consular
Games were instituted on the following occasion.
Romulus, the first king of Rome, had no sooner
assumed the government of the small band of adventurers
who were the ancestors of that illustrious
race of heroes, who long held all the nations of the
earth in subjection, than he found his kingdom in
danger of being totally destroyed in its birth; as
none of the inhabitants of the neighbouring states
were willing to form a matrimonial alliance with his
subjects; many of whom were refuged criminals
and exiled foreigners. To obtain wives for his
people, he was compelled to have recourse to a
stratagem, which Plutarch describes as follows:
“<cite>He (Romulus) circulated a report that he had discovered,
concealed under ground, the altar of a
certain god, whom they called</cite> <span class="smcap">Consus</span>, <cite>the God of
counsel, whose proper appellation is Neptunus Equestris,
or Neptune, the inventor of riding; for, except
at horse-races, when it is exposed to sight, this
altar is kept covered in the great circus; and, it
was said, that it was not improperly concealed, because
all counsels ought to be kept secret and hidden.
Romulus, having found the altar, caused proclamation
to be made, that, on an appointed day, a magnificent
sacrifice would be offered; and public games
and shows exhibited, which were to be open to all
who should choose to attend them. Upon this, great
numbers went there. The king, dressed in a purple
robe, was seated on high, surrounded by the chief
patricians: he was to arise, take up his robe, and
throw it over him, as a signal for the attack: his
subjects, with ready weapons, kept their eyes intently
fixed upon their sovereign; and, when the sign was
given, they drew their swords with a shout, and seized,
and carried off the daughters of the Sabines, who
fled, without offering resistance.</cite>”—<span class="smcap">Plutarch.</span></p>

<p>The games which were instituted on this singular
occasion were afterwards celebrated annually on
the 12th of the calends of September, and considered
to be an imitation of the Olympian Games
of the Greeks. The Consuales, being celebrated
in the Circus were sometimes called Circenses.
The conduct of the Romans in the before-mentioned
circumstances, and that of the Benjamites in a
like predicament is so uniformly similar, that whoever
attentively compares them, cannot think it
very improbable that Romulus derived the idea of
his stratagem from that passage of Jewish history.

<i>Quintus Fabius Labeo.</i><br>
</p>

<p>If the accuracy of Plutarch may be depended on,
Santra must have been mistaken in supposing
Quintus Fabius Labeo to be still living at the time
of the Andrian’s publication, or for several years
before its appearance. This conclusion is deduced
from the following circumstances: Quintus Fabius
Maximus, whose prudent method of delaying a
battle, and harassing his enemy, (in his campaigns
against Hannibal,) procured him the surname of
<i>Cunctator</i>, or <i>Delayer</i>, enjoyed the dignity of the
consulship <em>five</em> several times: he was first chosen
in the year of Rome 525, and, supposing that he obtained
that office in what Cicero calls <i lang="la">suo anno</i>, his
own year, that is, as soon as he had attained the
age required by law, Fabius must then have been
forty-three years of age, and, as he died in his
one hundredth year, he could not have been alive
after the year 582. Quintus Fabius Labeo, who
was the son of this hero, died (Plutarch informs us)
some years before his father; and, consequently,
could not have assisted Terence, even in his first
play, the Andrian, which did not appear till the
year of Rome 587. That Quintus Fabius Maximus
Cunctator was the father of Quintus Fabius Labeo
can admit of no doubt, though some authors who
have mentioned them have omitted to notice their
relationship. Plutarch expressly informs us, that
the son of Quintus Fabius Maximus was of consular
dignity, and, with the exception of the
Cunctator, Quintus Fabius Labeo was the only
Fabius whose name appears on record as consul,
from the year of Rome 521 to the year 611.</p>

<i>Marcus Popilius Lænas.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Madame Dacier thinks that the person here
meant was Caius Popilius Lænas, who shared the
consular government with Publius Ælius Ligur in
the year of Rome 581; but that learned and celebrated
lady assigns no reason why we should suppose
either Suetonius or Santra to have been incorrect
in affirming Marcus the brother of Caius to
have been the reputed assistant of Terence. Marcus
was a man of high reputation, and eminent
abilities: the following anecdote, related by Velleius
Paterculus, (<i>Book</i> <abbr title="One, Chapter">I. <i>Chap.</i></abbr> 10.) will afford
some idea of the resolute decision of his character.
“<cite>The king of Syria, Antiochus Epiphanes, (or the
illustrious) was at that time besieging Ptolemy, king
of Egypt. Marcus Popilius Lænas was sent ambassador
to Antiochus, to desire him to desist: he delivered
his message; the king replied that he would
consider of it; upon which Popilius drew a circle
round him in the sand on which they stood, and told
him, that he insisted on his final answer before he
quitted that circumscribed space. This resolute boldness
prevailed, and Antiochus obeyed the Roman
mandate.</cite>”</p>

<p>Marcus Popilius Lænas was the junior Consul for
the year of Rome 580: the name of his colleague
was Lucius Posthumius Albinus.</p>

<i>Menander.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Menander was born at Athens, 345 B.&nbsp;C., and
educated with great care by Theophrastus the peripatetic,
whose labours must have been amply repaid,
when he witnessed the proficiency of his pupil, who
distinguished himself by successful dramatic compositions
before he had attained his 21st year. With
the exception of a few fragments, his works are entirely
lost. Comedy was invented at Athens, and
divided into three kinds; <i>the old</i>, <i>the middle</i>, and
<i>the new</i>. The old comedy was that in which both
the names and the circumstances were real; the
middle, was where the circumstances were true,
but the names disguised. To these two kinds, Menander
had the glory of adding a third, which was
called the new comedy, where both the plot and the
characters were wholly fictitious. His style is said
to have been elegant, and his ideas and sentiments
refined. Dion Chrysostom considers his writings to
be an excellent model for orators. This great poet
wrote from 100 to 108 plays; from which Terence
took four of his, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, his Andrian, Eunuch, Self-tormentor,
and Brothers. Menander obtained a poetical
prize, eight several times; his chief competitor
was called Philemon.</p>

<p>Leucadia, or as it is now called Santa Maura, or
Lefcathia, is an island about 50 miles in circumference,
in that part of the Mediterranean which
was known among the ancients by the name of the
Ionian sea. This island was rendered famous by
one of its promontories called Leucas, and Leucate,
which overhangs the sea at a very considerable perpendicular
height: a leap from this promontory into
the water beneath, was reckoned among the Greeks
as an infallible cure for unhappy lovers of either
sex, and most of those who made the experiment,
found their love, and all the rest of their cares effectually
terminated by this wise step. The famous
poetess Sappho perished in this leap. <i>Vide The

<i>A Roman Knight.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Romans were divided into three classes. 1.
<dfn>The Patricians</dfn>, or nobility. 2. <dfn>The Equites</dfn>, or
knights. 3. <dfn>The Plebeians</dfn>, or the commons: that
is, all who were not included in the two first ranks.
The Equites, or knights, were in fact the Roman cavalry,
as they usually had no other: though all of
them were men of fortune; it being required by law
(at least under the Emperors, if not before) that each
Eques at his enrolment should possess 400 sestertia:
a sum equal to between 3,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> and 4,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
sterling: a person worth double that sum might be
chosen senator. Each knight was provided with a
horse, and a gold ring, at the public expense; and
at a general review, which took place every five
years, the Censor was empowered ignominiously to
deprive of his horse, and degrade from his rank,
any knight who by disgraceful conduct had proved
himself unworthy of his dignity.</p>

<i>A garden of XX jugera.</i><br>

<p>The jugerum, or Roman acre, contained 28,800
feet; consequently, Terence’s estate must have been
equal to rather more than 13 English acres: and (<em>as
a garden</em>) must have been of considerable value:
land in Italy, especially in the vicinity of the capital,
bearing a high price; though not so high as in the
reign of Trajan, who passed a law that every candidate
for an office should hold a third part of his property
in land. The Romans were particularly partial
to gardens; to improve and beautify them, they
bestowed great care, and expended large sums of
money; some of these gardens were of vast extent,
and most magnificently embellished with statues,
paintings, aqueducts, &amp;c., as were those of Cæsar
and Sallust.</p>

<i>The Villa Martis.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The ancient Roman villas were built with extraordinary
magnificence, according to those descriptions
of them which have reached modern times, and are
not unworthy of attention. The great pleasure the
Romans took in their villas, and gardens adjoining,
may be seen in the writings of many of the most eminent
among them; Varro, Cicero, Pliny, Cato, and
others, have described these delightful retirements
in a particular manner. In the villas of the richest,
were concentred all the attractions that art or nature
could be made to yield; and magnificence was
every where blended with convenience. For the
site of a villa of this description they chose the centre
of a fine park, well stocked with game and fish:
the building was generally lofty; (nearly 100 feet
in height) for the advantage of an extensive view;
as the <dfn>cœnatio</dfn> where the family met at meals was selected
in the upper story. The villa was divided
into two parts, called <dfn>urbana</dfn> and <dfn>rustica</dfn>: the first
contained the chambers used by the family and
guests, together with the places of amusement and
refreshment; as the baths, terraces, &amp;c. The <dfn>villa
rustica</dfn> was that part allotted to the slaves and domestics,
who were extremely numerous. Those
who wish for a minute description of the habits and
manners of the Romans, in the country, may be fully
gratified by consulting the following writers on the
subject; Varro and Cato <cite>de re rustica</cite>; Dickson on
<cite>Roman agriculture</cite>; and the works of Columella,
and Dionysius Halicarnasseus.</p>

<i>Afranius.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Lucius Afranius, a comic writer, was contemporary
with Terence, and elevated himself into
notice, by his imitations of that favourite poet, and
of his great prototype Menander. Fragments of
the compositions of Afranius are still extant: in his
work quoted by Suetonius he probably gave a poetical
description of the festival called Compitalia, or
Compitalitia, and mentioned Terence as the author
of comedies, which had been represented at that
festival.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<a id="note_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40">NOTE 40.</a><br>
<br>
<i>Compitalia.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Compitalia or Compitalitia were <em>originally</em>
ceremonies, (for nothing could be more improperly
denominated <em>festivals</em>) of a nature at once extraordinary,
disgusting and barbarous. It was never possible
to ascertain where, or by whom, they were
first instituted; though it is generally agreed that
they were revived by <i>Servius Tullius</i>, the sixth king
of Rome, who first introduced the observance of
them among his subjects about the year 200. They
were celebrated in honour of the goddess <i>Mania</i>,
and of the <i>Lares</i>, who were supposed to be her offspring.
The <i>Lares</i> were the household gods of the
Romans, and placed in the innermost recesses of their
houses. These household gods were small images
of their ancestors, which they always kept wrapped
in dog’s skin, (which was intended for an emblem of
<em>watchfulness</em>) as being for the protection of the
house and its inhabitants. They were also called
the <dfn>Manes</dfn> of their forefathers, from <dfn>Mania</dfn>. It was
pretended, that on consulting an oracle respecting
the religious means to be employed for ensuring domestic
security, the oracular response commanded
that <em>Heads should be sacrificed for Heads</em>, meaning,
that as divine vengeance required the lives of the
culprits, the people should offer the heads of others
instead of their own, and accordingly the Compitalia
were instituted on this occasion, and <em>human victims</em>
were on this preposterous pretence sacrificed with a
sow, to ensure family safety. The Romans, however,
had too much good sense to suffer a long continuance
of this diabolical folly: and they threw off
the yoke of the tyrannical Tarquin, and this obnoxious
custom at the same time. Lucius Junius Brutus
abolished the sacrifice of human beings; and as
the oracle required the offering of heads, he fulfilled
its commands by substituting the heads of onions
and poppies. They afterwards made figures of
wool, which they suspended at their doors, imprecating
all misfortunes on the images, instead of themselves.
Slaves were allowed their liberty during the
celebration of the Compitalia; and with freedmen
officiated as priests on the occasion. Being rendered
harmless by Brutus’ convenient interpretation
of the oracle, the Compitalia were continued till the
reigns of the emperors. The word Compitalia is by
some derived from Compita, crossways, because
during the ceremonies, the statues of the <i>Lares</i> were
placed in a spot where several streets met, and
crowned with flowers. I think it not improbable
that the original name was <dfn>Capitalia</dfn>, from <dfn>capita</dfn>,
<em>heads</em>, because <em>heads</em> were the requisite offerings.</p>

banished to Africa, where he died. Volcatius assigns

<i>Plautus.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Marcus Accius Plautus was a native of Sarsina,
a town of Umbria, near the Adriatic sea, and died
at Rome, 182 B. C., at the age of forty, leaving
behind him a literary reputation which very few, of
any age or county, have ever been able to equal.
Of those who refused to allow Plautus the title of
the <cite>First comic poet of Rome</cite>, scarcely any have disputed
his right to be second in the list, where Terence
holds the <em>first</em> place: some critics, indeed, have
gone so far as to prefer Plautus, even to Terence
himself; but Volcatius Sedigitus, whose judgment
did Terence great injustice, makes Plautus second
only to Cæcilius. The saying of Ælius Stilo is
worthy of being recorded; <span lang="la">“Musas Plautino sermone
locuturas fuisse, si Latinè loqui vellent,”</span> <cite>that
if the Muses wished to speak in Latin, they would
speak in the language of Plautus</cite>. This celebrated
man wrote 27 or 28 comedies, which, notwithstanding
the change of manners, kept possession of the
stage for nearly 500 years; and were performed
with applause as late as the reigns of Carus and
Numerian. Only 20 of them are now extant. The
following is the poet’s epitaph, written (as is supposed)
by Varro, though Pietro Crinito affirms it to
be the production of Plautus himself, of whom
Crinito has written a biographical account.</p>

<i>Cicero in his</i> <span lang="el">ΛΕΙΜΩΝ.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Cicero wrote a poem, to which he affixed the
title of <span lang="el">λειμων</span>, a Greek word signifying <dfn>a meadow</dfn>;
he gave it this name, probably, because, as meadows
are filled with various kinds of flowers, his work was
a numerous collection of flowers (<em>of literature</em>)
affording an agreeable variety. This poem, it
seems, consisted entirely of panegyrics on illustrious
persons. Nothing can be more erroneous than
a supposition that these verses were the forgery of
some grammarian: the Latin is too elegant, and
they are too finely written, to allow us to suppose
them a spurious production; and if Cicero had
never written any lines inferior to these; his fame
as a poet, might have equalled his fame as an
orator. Ausonius had these verses in his mind,
when he wrote</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tu quoque qui Latium lecto sermone Terenti,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comis, et astricto percurris pulpita socco.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What is still more remarkable, Cæsar commences
his lines on Terence, in Cicero’s words,
Tu quoque, &amp;c., for there is not the least doubt but
that Cæsar undertook this work, merely with a view
to irritate, and to contradict Cicero.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Madame Dacier.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The name of Cicero is too well known, to need
any further mention here; suffice it to say, that this
great orator was totally unsuccessful in his poetical
attempts, the chief fault of which was want of
harmony in the measure: it may be remarked of
Cicero, that very frequently his prose was written
with the music of verse, and his verse with the
roughness of prose.</p>

<i>Caius Julius Cæsar.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The poem, of which these lines formed a part,
is entirely lost; what remains of it, however, proves
Julius Cæsar to have been no mean poet, but he
seems to have excelled in every art of war and
<span class="lock">peace;—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the lines quoted by Suetonius were written in
ridicule of Cicero, they are another proof in support
of an opinion that has been very prevalent, that the
orator was not very high in the good graces of
Cæsar, whose dislike of him may be easily traced to
Marc Antony, Cæsar’s intimate and favourite companion,
and the most inveterate enemy of Cicero.</p>

<i>The Megalesian Games.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Megalesian games were celebrated annually
at Rome, in the beginning of April, with solemn
feasts, in honour of Cybele, otherwise called Rhea,
the mother of the gods. Opinions vary as to their
duration, some fixing it at six days, and others at
not more than one. Originally instituted in Phrygia,
these ceremonies were introduced at Rome,
during the <em>second Punic war</em>, when the statue of the
goddess was carried thither from Pessinus. They
consisted chiefly of scenic sports; and women
danced before this statue, which was held so sacred,
that no servant was allowed to approach it,
or to take any part in the games. They were called
Megalesian, from the Greek words, <span lang="el">μεγαλη</span>, great,
Cybele being known by the name of the Great Goddess,
and <span lang="el">Ευαλωσια</span>, another name of Cybele, as presiding
over husbandry. The festival <span lang="el">ΘΕΣΜΟΦΟΡΙΑ</span>,
celebrated in Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, in honour
of the same goddess resembled in many circumstances
the Roman Megalesia; the Latins appear
to have adopted partially, on various occasions, the
religious ceremonies of the Greeks, particularly in
their imitation of certain of the solemnities which
were observed at the <em>Eleusinian</em> mysteries.</p>

<i>Curule Ædilate.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Curule Ædiles, created in the year of Rome
388, were at first elected from among the patricians.
These magistrates were appointed to inspect all
public edifices, (whence their name) to fix the rate
of provisions, to take cognizance of disorders committed
within the city, and to examine weights and
measures: but their chief employment was to procure
the celebration of the various Roman games,
and to exhibit comedies and shews of gladiators;
on which account, though inferior in rank to the
Consuls, they precede them in the title of this play.
The Ædilate was an honourable office, and a primary
step to higher dignities in the republic. Curule
magistrates were those who were entitled to use the
<i lang="la">sella curulis</i>, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the consuls, prætors, curule ædiles,
and censors: this chair was called <dfn>curulis</dfn>, because
those privileged to use it, always carried it in their
chariots, to and from the tribunals at which they
presided. Tacitus informs us in his annals (<cite>Book
<abbr title="Thirteen, Chapter Thirty">XIII. Chap. XXX.</abbr></cite>) that in the year 809, the power
of the Ædiles, both curule, and plebeian, was very
much circumscribed; that their salary was regulated
anew; and limits fixed, as to the sum they
were allowed to impose as a fine.</p>

the consulate eight years after his Ædilate: the
name of his colleague was Cneus Cornelius Dolabella.
It is probable that this branch of the Fulvian
family assumed the agnomen of <cite>Nobilior</cite>, to distinguish
themselves as <dfn>nobiles</dfn> from the rest of the
Fulvii, who might not have had any claim to that
title. None but those, and the posterity of those,
who had borne some curule office, (<i>vide <a href="#note_48">note 48</a></i>)

amusement, united with instruction, have a
just and undeniable claim. However unjust the
Romans might have been in this particular, they
made an exception in favour of transcendent merit;
as in the case of the admirable Roscius, though the
mention made of this favourite performer by his
friend Cicero, shews the truth of the foregoing remark.
<span lang="la">“Cum artifex ejusmodi sit, ut solus dignus
videatur esse qui in scenâ spectetur; tum vir ejusmodi
fuit, ut <em>solus dignus videatur qui non accedat</em>;”</span>
<cite>so excellent an actor, that he only seemed worthy to
tread the stage, and yet so noble a man, that he seemed
to be the very last person that ought to appear there</cite>.
Though the Roman actors were not allowed their
due privileges as citizens, yet some of the most eminent
were often very great favourites with the people,
and created so much interest among them, that (as
Suetonius tells us) the parties of rival performers
disputing for precedence, have proceeded so far as
to terminate the quarrel in bloodshed. Turpio and
Attilius were actors of the first class, and were said
(<cite>vid. Terence Phorm:</cite>) <i lang="la">agere primas partes</i>, because
they always personated the principal characters in
the piece.</p>

<i>Præneste.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Præneste was a town of Latium, about twenty-four
miles from Rome, and founded by Cæculus,
as we are told by <i>Virgil, B. 7.</i></p>

<i>Equal flutes right and left handed.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Flutes were called in Latin <dfn>tibiæ</dfn>, because they
were made of the shank or shin-bone of some animal,

when they began to use wood,</p>

and left-handed flutes, has never been ascertained
with any degree of certainty: few subjects have
more obstinately baffled the researches of the

the moderns are acquainted with respecting the
ancient flutes, is written by the learned Madame
Dacier, part of which is quoted in the Preface to

<i>It is taken from the Greek.</i><br>
</p>

<p>All Terence’s comedies were of this class, which
was called <dfn>Palliatæ</dfn>, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, plays in which the scene
was laid in Greece. The class, called <dfn>Togatæ</dfn>,
were pieces entirely Roman. The palliatæ were
generally <em>new</em> comedies, of which Menander was
the inventor; but Pacuvius wrote the <em>middle</em>, and
Livius Andronicus the <em>old</em> comedy. (<i>Vide <a href="#note_33">Note 33</a>.</i>)
In the age in which Terence wrote his comedies,
the Romans were some degrees less advanced in
the refinements of civilization, than the Greeks.
But little more than a century before, Pyrrhus, king
of Epirus, thought them worthy of no better epithet
than that of “<em>barbarians</em>” in comparison with his
own subjects, who were not themselves the most
polished nation in the world. The Romans, therefore,
omitted no opportunity of improving the
manners and perfecting the education of their youth,
by sending them to mix with the Greeks, and to
unite themselves to the disciples of those Grecian
sages, who, as far as the light of reason, unassisted
by <em>divine revelation</em>, could penetrate, dispelled
the clouds of ignorance, and taught their
followers that happiness and wisdom can be attained
only by the virtuous. It was, doubtless, on
this account, that Terence chose Greece as the
scene of his comedies, which he intended should
portray to the Romans the manners, customs, and
characters of those whom they often held up as a
pattern of polished refinement, worthy the imitation
of the rising generation.</p>

<p>It is to this, doubtless, that we must attribute
Terence’s choice of Athens in preference to Rome
as the scene of his plays; as, particularly, in the
comedy which the critics call the <dfn>comedy of intrigue</dfn>,
the best judges agree that the scene is preferably
laid in that country in which it is meant to be performed.
But the comedies of Terence were more
of that description which Dr. Blair denominates
the <dfn>comedy of character</dfn>, and preferable to what he
calls the <dfn>comedy of intrigue</dfn>, because “it exhibits
the prevailing manners which mark the character of
the age in which the scene is laid. <em>Incidents</em> should
afford a proper field for the exhibition of character:
the action in comedy, though it demands the poet’s
care in order to render it animated and natural, is a
less significant and important part of the performance
than the action in tragedy; as, in comedy, it
is what men say, and how they behave, that draws
our attention, rather than what they perform or
what they suffer.”</p>

<i>The consulate of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and
Cneus Sulpicius Galba.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The consuls, the chief magistrates of the Roman
republic were first created at the expulsion
of the kings in the year 244: they were two
in number, and chosen annually. The consuls
were the head of the <i>Senate</i>, which they assembled
and dismissed at pleasure, though it was not their
exclusive privilege, as a dictator, his master of the
horse, the prætors, military tribunes, and even the
tribunes of the people, might also, on certain occasions,
assemble the Senate. The consuls, however,
were the supreme judges of all differences;
they commanded the armies of the republic, and,
during their consulate, enjoyed almost unbounded
power, which could only be checked by the creation
of a dictator, to whom the consuls were subordinate.
It was requisite that every candidate for the consulship
should be <em>forty-three</em> years of age, and that he
should previously have discharged the functions of
Prætor, Ædile, and Quæstor. The consuls were
always patricians till the year 388, when, by the
influence of their tribunes, the people obtained a
law, that henceforth one of them should be a
plebeian. The ensigns of consular dignity were
twelve guards, called <dfn>lictors</dfn>, (who bore the <i lang="la">fasces</i>,)
and a robe, fringed with purple, worn by these magistrates,
during their consulate. The names of
the consuls are mentioned in the title of this play,
merely to fix its date, as the Roman method of reckoning
their years was by the names of the consuls.
This custom continued for 1,300 years. Marcus
Claudius Marcellus was the grandson of the great
Marcellus, slain in the year 545; for Caius Sulpicius
Galba, <i>vide</i> <a href="#note_27">Note 27</a>.</p>

<br>
<i>Prologue.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Madame Dacier grounds on the first line of this
Prologue an opinion, that the Andrian was not
Terence’s first play: but, if that learned and
justly-celebrated lady had attentively considered the
relation the sixteen following lines of the Prologue
bear to the first, she could not have made this deviation
from her usual extreme accuracy. Whether
the Andrian was, or was not, our Author’s first production,
is a question of more curiosity than real
importance: it has, however, undergone some discussion
among the learned; and, in my opinion, it
may be clearly ascertained by an attentive perusal
of the Prologue to the Andrian, and learned and
unlearned are equally competent to decide upon it.
Let us now examine the proof. The first seven
lines inform us, that “when the poet began to
write, he thought he had only to please the people,
but that he finds it far otherwise; as he is obliged
to write a Prologue to answer the objections of an
older bard.”</p>

<p>If we stop here, it is natural enough to conclude,
that in the Prologue to the Andrian, he is alluding
to censures passed on some former play. But, if
we look at the next nine lines we see that <em>in the
prologue to the Andrian</em>, he repels a censure <em>not
passed on any former production, but on the</em> <span class="smcap">Andrian</span>
<em>itself</em>. Listen, says he, to their objections,
which are, in short, that in the composition of <em>this
very Andrian</em>, he has made a confused mixture of
two of Menander’s plays. What allusion is made
to any former writings? None: the snarling criticisms
of the older bard were directed <em>only</em> against
the <cite>Andrian</cite>. I imagine that the case was thus:
Terence wrote the Andrian, and procured its representation,
probably without any Prologue, (which
was sometimes dispensed with, as we see in Plautus,)
the play, and its author, were, probably,
cried down and abused by this older bard and his
admirers, who might envy the visible superiority of
Terence, who <em>afterwards</em> composed the Prologue in
question, to answer their objections. The reader
is referred for further proof, to Suetonius’s Life of
Terence, a translation of which is prefixed to this
play.</p>

<i>To answer the snarling malice of an older poet.</i><br>
</p>

<p>According to Donatus, the name of this older
bard was Lucius Lavinius: but there can be little
doubt but that name is a corruption of Luscius
Lanuvinus, the arch-enemy of Terence, whom he
handles so roughly in his Prologue to the Eunuch.
Luscius was a poet of considerable talent. Volcatius
gives him the ninth place,</p>

<i>Menander wrote the Andrian and Perinthian.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The <cite>Perinthian</cite> (a fine comedy now lost) was so
called from Perinthus, a town of Thrace, the name
of which was afterwards changed to Heraclea, and
that name is now corrupted to Herecli, or Erekli,
its present appellation. Erekli is a town in the
Turkish province of Romania, on the north of the
sea of Marmora, and about sixty miles from Constantinople.
It is a place of some consequence
from its vicinity to the Turkish capital. For the

<i>They censure Nævius, Plautus, Ennius.</i><br>
</p>

<p>An account of Nævius has been given in <a href="#note_41">Note 41</a>,
and of Plautus in <a href="#note_42">Note 42</a>. Ennius was the tenth
comic poet of Rome, according to Volcatius, who
says, “Antiquitatis causâ decimum addo Ennium.”
If it be true that Ennius was but the tenth in poetical
merit, the greatest glory of the nine who
were above him, must have been the distinguished
honour of excelling this highly extolled poet.
Ennius was born in the year of Rome 515, and
died in 585; though he obtained the privileges of
a Roman citizen, he was, by birth, a Calabrian, as
<cite>Ovid</cite> expressly tells us, and informs us, that his
statue was placed on the tomb of the Scipios, because
he had so nobly celebrated their renowned
actions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ennius emeruit, Calabris in montibus ortus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contiguus poni, Scipio, magne tibi.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Ennius, among Calabrian mountains born,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Deserves, O Scipio, to be placed by thee.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reader cannot become acquainted with the
enthusiastic admiration of the Romans for the brilliant
performances of Ennius, better than by a perusal
of some of the many and great encomiums
passed on him by those who, though they lived
after him, may be called his competitors for literary
fame. <cite>Cicero</cite> calls him,</p>

<p><span lang="la">“Ingeniosus, poeta et auctor valde bonus.”</span>—<cite>A
man of great abilities and wit, and an admirable
writer both of poetry and of prose.</cite> <cite>Horace</cite> also</p>

Simo. <i>Carry in these things directly.</i><br>
</p>

<p>What “<em>those things</em>” were, though a subject of no
great importance, has been discussed with extreme
diligence by various learned commentators, who
have not a little differed in opinion. The idea of a
French commentator, who supposed Simo to allude
to furniture bought by him for his son’s wedding, is
ridiculed by the learned Madame Dacier, who has
herself suffered the same treatment under the hands
of some of our English critics, for interpreting them
in the sense I have adopted. That Simo should
provide furniture for a marriage which he had but
slight hopes of negotiating at that time, is not
very probable. But Athenian slaves performed all
domestic offices in their masters’ houses: and
Sosia, even after he became a freedman might
have practised cookery, in which, perhaps, he excelled.
He uses the words “<i lang="la">mea ars</i>,” <cite>my art</cite>,
and Simo answers him with “<i lang="la">isthac arte</i>,” <cite>that art</cite>,
by which it is clear that he means some particular
art. The word art has in English both a general
and particular sense; but, in Latin, “<i lang="la">ars</i>” is generally
used only in the latter.</p>

<p>Sosia speaks in this character also at the end of
the scene, <span lang="la">“Sat est <dfn>curabo</dfn>,”</span> curo, meaning to

invited their clients or followers to supper, where a

The art of cookery, in Greece, was, in the earlier
ages, far from being accounted degrading, and was,
indeed, frequently practised by men very far above
a servile station.</p>

<p>I mention this, lest those who are unacquainted
with these customs, might object against our

condescension, in making a confidant of one who
held an office of this nature.</p>

<br>
<i>When I first bought you as my slave.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Slaves, among the Greeks, formed a very considerable
portion of the population of a city, and,
in some places, were more numerous than the citizens
themselves. In Athens, all domestic offices
were performed by slaves, who were employed also
in the capacities of tutors, scribes, stewards, overseers,
and husbandmen, according to their respective
talents: when a slave manifested great abilities,
he was taught the art or science for which he
seemed most fitted. Some were instructed in
literature, and often so distinguished themselves
by their writings, that they obtained their freedom.
The slaves of the Athenians were either taken in
war, or purchased, or reduced to slavery for some
crime: they were divided into <em>two</em> classes: 1. those
who were natives of some part of Greece, who had
the privilege of redeeming themselves; who, if
cruelly treated, might appeal to the archons, and
change their master; and whose lives were not in
their master’s power; 2. those slaves who were
transported from barbarous nations, who were
wholly at the disposal of their owners in every
respect. The price of a slave varied according to
his qualifications; some were worth about 10<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
sterling, some were valued at 20<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, and others much
higher. The Athenians were celebrated for the
gentleness with which they treated their slaves.
Xenophon informs us, that they frequently spoiled
them by excessive indulgence. Slaves were made
free, if they rendered any essential service to the
government; and frequently received their liberty
as a reward for their fidelity and attachment to their
master, and his family. For further information

their habits and manners, <i>vide</i> Notes <a href="#note_62">62</a>, <a href="#note_63">63</a>, <a href="#note_64">64</a>,

<i>I gave you freedom.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The ceremony of <span lang="el">Ἀπελεύθερια</span>, or giving a slave
his liberty, was performed in Athens as follows, the
slave kneeled down at the feet of his master, who
struck him a slight blow, saying, “<cite>Be free</cite>;” or
he took the slave before a magistrate, and there
formally declared him at liberty. These ceremonies
were extremely similar to those used by
the Romans on the same occasion. The Greeks
sometimes set their slaves at liberty in a public
assembly, which Æschines describes as follows,
<span lang="el">Ἄλλοι δέ τινες ὑποκηρυξάμενοι, τοὺς αὑτῶν
οἰκέτας ἀφίεσαν ἀπελευθέρους, μάρτυρας τῆς ἀπελευθερίας τοὺς Ἕλληνας
ποιούμενοι.”</span>—<cite>Others, when they had obtained
silence by means of the heralds, gave their
household slaves their liberty; and made the assembled
Greeks witnesses of their manumission.</cite></p>

<p>The same author mentions a very singular law,
which stigmatized with infamy any person who
should proclaim the freedom of a slave in the theatre.
<span lang="el">“Καὶ διαῤῥήδην ἀπαγορεύει μήτε οἰκέτην ἀπελευθεροῦν
ἐν τῷ θεάτρῳ――――――――ἢ ἄτιμον εἶναι τὸν κήρυκα.”</span>—<cite>And</cite>
this law <cite>clearly forbids that any person shall
manumit a slave in the theatre————-and decrees
infamy to the herald who shall proclaim his
freedom there</cite>.</p>

<p>Slaves were called <span lang="el">οἰκέται</span>, and <span lang="el">πελάται</span>, but,
after they became free, received the appellation of
<span lang="el">ἀπελεύθεροι</span>, and enjoyed all the privileges granted to
the <span lang="el">νόθοι</span>, or illegitimate citizens, who were not admitted
to all the rights of those whose parents were
both freeborn Athenian citizens. It was usual for
a freedman to continue with his master, who was
called his <span lang="el">προστατης</span>, or patron; he was also allowed
to choose a sort of guardian, who was called
<span lang="el">ἐπίτροπος</span>.</p>

<i>Nor have you given me any cause to repent that I
did so.</i><br>
</p>

<p>An emancipated slave was bound to perform
certain services for his former master: he was to
assist him in any emergency to the utmost of his
power: and, if he proved remiss in these duties,
was liable to a severe punishment. No freedman
could appear in a court of justice against his patron,
either to give evidence in his own suit, or in that of
another.</p>

<i>It pains me to be thus reminded of the benefits you

<p>By the Athenian laws, any freedman convicted of
ingratitude to his former master, was reduced a
second time to a state of slavery: but, if a freedman
was brought to a trial on a charge of this nature,
and acquitted of it, he was declared <span lang="el">τελέως ἐλεύθερος</span>,
<dfn>perfectly free</dfn>, and was then wholly released from
all obligations of service to his former patron.</p>

<p>This is the <i lang="la">initium narrationis</i>, the first part of
the narration, and, by far the longest: it is, in the
original, inimitably beautiful. Scarcely any branch
of dramatic writing is more difficult than <em>narration</em>,
which, unless composed in that happy vein, attainable
by so few, generally proves embarrassing to
the actor, and tiresome to the auditors. The
writings of Terence abound with narrations, a necessary
consequence of his strict adherence to the
unities. A judicious French writer, whose opinions
(<em>as a critic</em>,) have ever been treated with deference,
speaking of our author’s excellence in this branch of
the drama, makes his eulogium in just and forcible
terms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Terence is without a rival, especially in his
narrations, which flow along with a smooth and
even course, like a clear and transparent river. We
see no parade of sentiment, no glare of obtrusive
wit: no smart epigrammatical sentences, which Nicole
and Rochefoucault only can make acceptable.
When he applies a maxim, it is in so plain and familiar
a manner, that it has all the simplicity of a
proverb. He introduces nothing but what appertains
to the subject. I have perused, and re-perused
the writings of this poet with the greatest attention,
and have laid them aside with the impression that
there is not a scene too much in any play, nor a
line too much in any scene.”</p>

<em>art</em> and wit of a Terence to prevent them from seeming
too prolix.</p>

<p>This source may be found in those irksome <em>unities</em>
of <em>time</em> and <em>place</em>, those leaden fetters of dramatic
genius, which, by chaining down the imagination
and talents of many of the ancient, and even
some of the modern, dramatic writers, have deprived
the world of more, than the embellishments they may
have given to composition can ever repay.</p>

<p>Terence, in all his works, in compliance with the
reigning taste of his age, observed the unities of
<em>action</em>, <em>time</em>, and <em>place</em>, with the most scrupulous exactness:
and this observance is the chief reason that
his comedies can never succeed on any modern
stage. His plays are crowded with narratives,
which, however beautifully written, will never yield
that attraction to an audience, which they find in
busy and lively action. He cannot bring on the stage
what is supposed to happen in the next street, or adjoining
house, it must therefore be <em>related</em>. All the
story of the piece <em>must</em> be supposed to pass in a very
few hours: all those events which cannot be imagined
to take place in <em>one day</em>, and which, when represented
to the spectators in the <em>modern drama</em>,
are often of the greatest interest, must, by the law
of the unity of time be <em>related</em>. Of what a scene, to
instance one of <em>many</em>, has the unity of place robbed
us in Terence’s Eunuch! where Laches (<cite>Act 5</cite>)
rushes into the house of Thais. How many modern
plays, in which the unities were preserved, ever kept
the stage a month? None: if we except Ben Jonson’s
“<cite>Silent Woman</cite>,” “<cite>The Adventures of Five
Hours</cite>,” and a very few others; and it may well be
doubted whether even our immortal <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
himself, if he had shackled his genius with these
rules, would not have been generally confined to the
closet. The practice of that great poet, and of most
of the modern dramatists of all countries; who have
observed <em>only</em> (the rule of all stages, ancient and
modern,) unity of action, is a tacit condemnation of
the other two: and the fiat of Dr. Johnson speaks a
yet plainer language. He has decided on the value
of the unities in his preface to Shakspeare: and
though what he has written respecting them is too
long to be inserted here, the following extracts will
not be unacceptable, as they shew the grounds on
which it is assumed that dramatic writers ought, in
general, to dispense with the unities of <em>time</em> and
<em>place</em>.</p>

<p>“The critics hold it impossible, that an action of
months or years can be possibly believed to pass in
three hours. The spectator, who knows that he
saw the first act at Alexandria, cannot suppose that
he sees the next at Rome; he knows that he has not
changed his place, and that the place cannot change
itself; that what was a house can never become a
plain; that what was Thebes, can never be Persepolis.
Such is the triumphant language with which a
critic exults over the miseries of an irregular poet;
it is time, therefore, to tell him, that he assumes as
an unquestionable principle, a position, which,
while his breath is forming it into words, his understanding
pronounces to be false. It is false, that
any representation is mistaken for reality; that any
dramatic fable, in its materiality was ever credible,
or, for a single moment, was ever credited. The
objection arising from the impossibility of passing
the first hour at Alexandria, and the next at Rome,
supposes that when the play opens, the spectator
really imagines himself at Alexandria; and believes
that his walk to the theatre has been a voyage to
Egypt, and that he lives in the days of Antony and
Cleopatra. Surely he that can imagine this may
imagine more. He that can take the stage at one
time for the Palace of the Ptolemies, may take it in
half an hour for the promontory of Actium: delusion,
if delusion be admitted, has no certain limitation.
The truth is, that (judicious) spectators are
always in their senses, and know from the first act
to the last, that the stage is only a stage, and that
the players are only players: and by supposition as
place is introduced, time may be extended.” Dr.
Johnson concludes this subject as follows; “He
that, <em>without diminution</em> of any other <em>excellence</em>, shall
preserve all the unities unbroken, deserves the like
applause with the architect, who shall display all
the orders of architecture in a citadel, without any
deduction from its strength; but the principal beauty
of a citadel is to exclude the enemy; and the greatest
graces of a play are to copy nature, and instruct
life.”</p>

<p>It is needless to add any thing to these arguments,
as they must be deemed conclusive. The
plays of our author are better calculated, perhaps, to
please in the closet by his mode of writing, as it
adds to perspicuity: Terence is, probably, the greatest
practical champion for the three unities that
ever did, or ever will, exist. His easy flowing
<em>narratives</em>, judiciously divided, and introduced with
so much art, as in some places to seem no narratives
until they are concluded, remedy as much as
possible the inconveniences attendant on this mode
of writing.</p>

<i>When my son Pamphilus arrived at man’s estate.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In the Latin, <i>postquam excessit ex Ephebis</i>, <i>after
he was removed from the class of young men called</i>
<span lang="el">ἔφηβοι.</span></p>

<p>All the Athenian citizens were publicly registered
three several times. 1. In their <em>infancy</em>, on the <em>second day</em>
of the festival <span lang="el">ἀπατούρια</span>, called <span lang="el">ἀνάῤῥυσις</span>.
2. When they were <em>18 years of age</em>, they were registered
on the <em>third day</em> of the <span lang="el">ἀπατούρια</span>, called
<span lang="el">κουρεῶτις</span>, when they received the title of <span lang="el">ἔφηβοι</span>.
3. At <em>20 years of age</em>, they were registered for the
last time at the feast called <span lang="el">βενδίδεια</span> on the 19th
of the month, Thargelion, when they were said to be
admitted “<em>among the men</em>.” These ceremonies
were used to prevent the intrusion of persons, who
had no claim to the title of Athenian citizen, which
was an honour, that even foreign kings thought worthy
of their pursuit. Having quitted the class of
the <span lang="el">ἔφηβοι</span>, Pamphilus, at the time mentioned by
Simo, must have been 20 years of age.</p>

<i>The schools of the Philosophers.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Several schools of Philosophy were established at
Athens, in which philosophers of different sects presided,
and gave instructions to those of Athens, and
of other countries, whose fortunes allowed them leisure
to pursue studies of this nature. The buildings
in which the philosophers delivered their lectures
were provided at the public expense: they
were called <dfn>Gymnasia</dfn>, and built in divisions, some
for study called <span lang="el">στοαὶ</span>, and others for various exercises,
as wrestling, pugilism, dancing, &amp;c.; these
were denominated <span lang="el">παλαίστρα</span>. The principal <dfn>Gymnasia</dfn>
in Athens were the Lyceum, where Aristotle
taught; the academy, in which Plato presided; and,
lastly, the Cynosarges, which gave the name of
Cynics to that sect of philosophers, founded in this
place by Antisthenes. (<cite>vid. Plutarch’s Life of Themistocles</cite>).</p>

<i>In these times flattery makes friends; truth, foes.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Madame Dacier has elucidated this passage in an
elegant and ingenious criticism, which clears Pamphilus
from the charge of flattery which Sosia appears
to insinuate against him. The sentence in the
original runs thus: <span lang="la">“namque hoc tempore <em>obsequium
amicos veritas odium parit</em>.”</span> “When Simo
spoke of the obliging temper of his son, he intended
to describe him as behaving with that complaisant
politeness which is as remote as possible from flattery;
the practice of which never requires of a man
any thing inconsistent with the laws of truth and
candour; otherwise he would have blamed his son,
instead of praising him. But Sosia, following the
example of people of his own rank, who always look
on the dark side of every thing, takes this opportunity
of censuring the manners of the age, by declaring
that people were unwilling to hear the truth.
Thus he mistakes <em>obsequium</em>, which really means <dfn>an
amiable mildness of manners</dfn>, for <em>assentatio</em>, <dfn>servile
flattery</dfn>, a vice which shows weakness of mind, and
baseness of heart: and which renders those of our
friends who practise it, more dangerous than even
our enemies themselves. There is more ingenuity
in this passage than appears at first sight.”</p>

<p>For some further very valuable critical observations,
the reader is referred to the preface to a translation
of Phædrus’s fables, published at Paris, about
the middle of the 17th century. Besides very able
remarks on the Andrian, and the rest of Terence’s
plays, the translator gives an ingenious comparison
between fable and comedy; he also translated into
French, three of Terence’s comedies, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, The Andrian,
The Brothers, and Phormio.</p>

<i>The Island of Andros.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This island is situated in the Ægean sea, or, as it
is now called, the Archipelago; it is distant from the
Piræus, or port of Athens, about 500 of the stadia
Olympica, or rather more than 50 English miles.
It retains its original appellation. Bacchus seems
to have been the reputed patron of this island;
which was also called Antandros, and has been
mistaken by some for the Antandros of Phrygia
Minor, where Æneas built his fleet. <i>Vide</i> Ovid’s

<i>The neglect of her relations.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The relations of unmarried women in Greece
were bound by law to provide for them, either by
seeing them married to some suitable person, or to
furnish them with the means of support according
to their rank in life; or if a woman had no near kindred,
this duty devolved upon a guardian called
<span lang="el">κυριος</span>. It is probable that this obligation extended
equally to the paternal and maternal relations,
though the latter generally acted only in case of
the former becoming extinct. Terence warrants
the supposition of relations on both sides, being
compelled to act, as he uses the word <dfn>cognatus</dfn>,
which signifies strictly a relation by the mother’s
side, <dfn>agnatus</dfn>, on the contrary, is never employed
but to designate a kinsman by the father’s side,
though <em>cognatus</em> is often used as a common term for
both; and such is its meaning in this passage: for
if the law had been confined to the father’s relations,
Terence would certainly have used <em>agnatus</em>, and
thereby clearly designated the particular persons
who were bound to observe it.</p>

<i>The distaff and the loom.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Greek and Roman women led generally very
domesticated lives, and passed a considerable portion
of their time in spinning and weaving. The
simple manners of the earlier ages obliged each family
to depend, in a great measure, on itself, for the
supply of its various wants, and the kings and heroes
of antiquity, might doubly prize a mantle or a
vest, wrought by the hands of those who were dearest
to them. Wool was usually worn; but linen,
though highly valued, seems to have been but rarely
used. When the Greeks became more refined, this
simplicity of manners among women of rank gave
place to less laborious habits, and slaves were instructed
in the art of spinning and weaving.</p>

<i>Several lovers made their addresses to her, &amp;c.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This passage has been elegantly and chastely
softened by an ingenious French writer, who flourished
about the year 1650. I shall subjoin in this,
and other subsequent notes, the various alterations
made by this judicious editor, together with the
original passages: the lines he has introduced are
beautifully written, and a close imitation of the style
of Terence: I cannot doubt but they will be considered
worthy of a perusal: they are a proof of a
laudable delicacy, which was but too rarely to be
met with in many of the poets of both England and
France, <em>in the 17th century</em>.</p>

<p>The original passage runs thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Primùm hæc pudicè vitam, parcè, ac duriter</div>

<p>Which is altered by the French translator to the
<span class="lock">following:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Primum hæc pudicè vitam, parce, ac duriter</div>

<p>“At first she lived chastely, and penuriously, and
laboured hard, managing with difficulty to gain a
livelihood with the distaff and the loom: but soon
after several lovers made their addresses to her, and
as we are all naturally prone to idleness, and averse
to labour, and <em>as they made her promises of marriage,
she was too negligent of her reputation, and admitted
their visits oftener than was prudent</em>.”</p>

<i>Aha! thought I, he is caught.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In the Latin, Certè captus est. <span class="smcap">Habet</span>. Terence
borrowed this expression (<em>habet</em>) from the amphitheatre
at Rome, where men called <dfn>gladiators</dfn>, who
were (for the chief part) captives and slaves, fought
before the people: who looked with great delight
on these combats, which often terminated in death to
half the persons engaged. When a gladiator was
wounded, the people exclaimed <span class="smcap">Habet</span>, <dfn>he has it</dfn>,
and thus the word was often used at Rome, in the
sense adopted by Terence.</p>

<i>He paid his share, and supped with the rest.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In the Latin <i lang="la">symbolum dedit</i>, <dfn>he gave his ring as a
token, or pledge</dfn>. This phrase is an allusion to a
custom which prevailed chiefly at Rome. When a
party agreed to dine together at their own expense,
or, in other words, to club together for an entertainment:
each of the party <dfn>gave his ring</dfn> to him
who had the care of providing the feast, as a symbol
or token that he, the owner of the ring, was to
join the company, and defray his share of the expense.
Hence, he who paid nothing, was called
<dfn>asymbolus</dfn>. Rings were also given in contracts
instead of a bond: and used for tokens of various
kinds. The Greeks also seem to have called rings
by the same name, <span lang="el">σύμβολα</span>.</p>

<br>
<i>To give his daughter to Pamphilus with a large
dowry.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The word dowry, which is called, in Greek,
<span lang="el">προὶξ</span>, or <span lang="el">μείλια</span>, or <span lang="el">ἕδνα</span>, originally meant the sum
which a man gave to the family of the woman he
married, and with which he might be said to purchase
his wife: but, as the Greeks grew more refined,
and also more wealthy, this custom was
wholly abolished; and the dowry was given by the
wife’s relations to the husband, to assist him in the
maintenance of her and of her children. The dowries
of women were, in Athens, considered a subject
of great importance; and many laws were
framed by the Athenian legislators, (particularly by
Solon,) to provide for the well ordering of women’s
fortunes. An heiress could be disposed of in marriage,
only by her father, grandfather, or brother:
if she had neither of these relations, the archons
determined who was to be her husband; and it was
held so important to keep her estate in the family,
that <em>at one time</em> a law prevailed, that if an heiress
had no children by her first husband, she was
taken from him by the authority of the archons,
and given to her nearest relation. A wife, who
brought a fortune to her husband, was called
<span lang="el">γυνὴ</span>; she who brought none <span lang="el">παλλακὴ</span>. Solon, apprehensive
of mercenary unions, at one time,
passed a law, that a woman should carry to her
husband only some furniture, and four or five
changes of dress. But this seems to have been
little observed.</p>

<p>The large dowry which <i>Simo</i> says <i>Chremes</i> offered
with Philumena, we may fairly suppose to
have been twenty talents, as <i>Chremes</i> imagined he
had but one daughter to portion off; when he had
discovered <i>Glycera</i>, he gave her a dowry of ten
talents; and we must suppose that he reserved as
much more for <i>Philumena</i>. This will give us an
idea of what the portions of the Athenian women
usually were, and of the fortune of a citizen.</p>

<p>Twenty Greek talents were nearly equal to 5,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
sterling, according to some authors, though writers
differ widely as to the amount of the Attic talent;
Dr. Arbuthnot makes it equal to 193<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 15<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr>, Mr.
Raper to 232<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 3<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> It is agreed on all sides that
the Attic talent consisted of 6,000 drachmæ; but
the value of the drachma was never correctly ascertained.

<i>I contracted my son.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Athenian youth were not allowed to dispose
of themselves in marriage without consulting their
parents, who had almost unlimited authority over
them: if they had no parents, guardians, called
<span lang="el">ἐπίτροποι</span>, were appointed to control them.</p>

<p>But it does not appear that any particular ceremonies
were used in Athens, in contracting a bride
and bridegroom, previous to the day of marriage;
and I rather imagine, Terence, in order to make the
subject clear to his Roman auditors, alluded, by the
word <dfn>despondi</dfn>, to the <dfn>Roman custom of betrothing</dfn>,
called <dfn>sponsalia</dfn>, which they performed as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Some days before the wedding, the intended
bride and bridegroom, with their friends, met together
at the lady’s residence, and the parent or
guardian of each (as I imagine) asked each other,
<cite>Spondes? Do you betroth her or him?</cite> Then the other
party answered, <cite>Spondeo, I do betroth, &amp;c.</cite> Then
the deeds were signed, the dowry agreed on, and
the day appointed for the marriage.</p>

<p>To understand the full force of Simo’s remark,
when he says how much he was struck with the
contrast between Glycera and the rest of the
mourners, it is necessary that the reader should
be informed, that, in Athens, no woman under sixty
years of age was allowed to appear at a funeral;

<i>I approach the women who were following the body.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Literally, the women who were <em>walking</em> after the
body. Though those women who were hired to
follow a corpse, <em>walked</em> in procession, it was very
usual in Greece, to attend funerals in carriages,
and on horseback: but Chrysis, not being represented
as a citizen, the ceremonies, in respect to
the procession, must be supposed to be different.
The interment of the dead was considered of such
extreme importance throughout the whole of
Greece, that to want the rites of sepulture, was
deemed by the natives of that country, a much
greater misfortune than even death itself. The
Greeks (and many other nations) believed that the
spirit of a person whose corpse was unburied,
could never obtain admittance to the Elysian fields:
their imaginary place of reward for virtuous men
after death. Two different methods of disposing of
the dead prevailed in Greece. The most ancient
of the two (as is generally allowed,) was much the
same as the modern practice, the corpse was interred
in a coffin, and deposited in the earth. The
other mode was to burn the body, and to preserve
the ashes. The Athenians seem to have used both
methods indiscriminately: their funerals were
usually conducted by torch-light. On the third or
fourth day after death, (though the time was varied
according to circumstances,) the corpse was placed
on a bier, with the feet towards the door; and an
obolus put into its mouth, to defray the passage
across the Styx: a certain form of words was then
pronounced over the body, which was afterwards
carried out, and followed by the mourners: those
of the same sex as the deceased were to be nearest
the corpse: when it was placed on the pile, and a
second form of words recited over it, some one of
the mourners, (usually the nearest relation,) applied
a torch to the wood; and, if the deceased
was of high rank, animals of various kinds, and
sometimes even <em>human victims</em>, were slaughtered,
and thrown into the flames. The ashes of the
dead were collected from the extinguished pile
into an urn, and with some further ceremonies deposited
in a sepulchre. The Romans burned their
dead in a similar manner. For a further mention
of Greek funerals, <i>vide</i> Notes <a href="#note_77">77</a>, <a href="#note_78">78</a>, <a href="#note_80">80</a>, <a href="#note_81">81</a>.</p>

<p>Tombs, called by the Greeks <span lang="el">τάφοι</span>, or <span lang="el">τύμβοι</span>,
which signify both the grave and the monument,
were not allowed to be within the city of Athens,
but were placed either in the public burial-place,
or in private grounds belonging to the relatives of
the deceased: it was not unusual to erect them
by the road side at some distance from the city,
whence the expression, so common on monuments,
<cite lang="la">Siste Viator</cite>, <dfn>Stay Traveller</dfn>. The public burial-place
of the Athenians was in that part of the
Ceramicus situated beyond the city: it was very
extensive. The other part of the Ceramicus contained
the old forum, called <span lang="el">ἀρχαία ἀγορὰ</span>.</p>

<p>An eminent English poet, Sir Richard Steele,
has endeavoured to adapt Terence’s Andrian to the
taste of an English audience, and has succeeded in
that attempt, in his play, called <cite>The Conscious
Lovers</cite>, as well as circumstances would permit.
A French poet of equal eminence, Monsieur Baron,
has made a similar attempt in French verse,
and has met with equal success in his Andrienne:
he has kept much closer to the original than has
Sir Richard Steele; indeed, many scenes of the
Andrienne are a literal version of Terence. I purpose
to point out the most material changes which
the two modern poets have made in the incidents:
the bent of the dramatic taste of the nation of each,
may be discovered, in some measure, from a comparison
between the <em>English</em>, the <em>French</em>, and the
<em>Roman</em> dramatist. M. Baron has not made any
alteration in the scene at Chrysis’ funeral, where
Simo discovers his son’s attachment to Glycera;
but Sir R. Steele, has altered the mode of discovery
to <em>a quarrel at a masquerade</em>; and his
scene, though it may want the pathos of the original,
yet displays the filial affection of Bevil, the
English Pamphilus, in a very amiable light. Sir
Richard has modernized the characters of Simo
and Sosia in Sir John Bevil and Humphrey.</p>

who led the lady in the Indian mantle, presented
that gay creature to the rustic, and bid him (like
Cymon in the fable) grow polite, by falling in love,
and let that worthy gentleman alone, meaning me.
The clown was not reformed, but rudely offered to
force off my mask; with that the gentleman,
throwing off his own, appeared to be my son; and,
in his concern for me, tore off that of the nobleman.
At this, they seized each other, the company
called the guards, and, in the surprise, the
lady swooned away; upon which my son quitted
his adversary, and had now no care but of the lady;
when, raising her in his arms, ‘Art thou gone,’
cried he, ‘for ever?—Forbid it, Heaven!’—She
revives at his known voice, and, with the most
familiar, though modest gesture, hangs in safety
over his shoulders weeping; but wept as in the
arms of one before whom she could give herself
a loose, were she not under observation. While
she hides her face in his neck, he carefully conveys
her from the company.”—<span class="smcap">Conscious Lovers.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Sir John Bevil makes the same trial of his son,
as Simo of his: and young Bevil makes the same
reply with Pamphilus. The only difference in the
conduct of the plot in that part is, that Bevil is not
apprized of his father’s stratagem by his own
servant; but by Humphrey, which, as it shews a
sort of half-treachery in him, is an inferior arrangement
to that of the Latin poet.</p>

<i>That Pamphilus had actually married this strange
woman.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The expression <span lang="el">ξένα</span>, <i lang="la">peregrina</i>, or <dfn>strange woman</dfn>,
was generally used amongst eastern nations,
to signify a woman of light character: it is very
frequently employed in the Holy Writings in that
sense. <i>Vide</i> Judges, <abbr title="chapter eleven, verse">chap. xi. ver. 2</abbr>; Proverbs,
<abbr title="chapter five verses">chap. v. ver.</abbr> 3. 10, 20. Thais, in the Eunuch,
speaking of her mother, says,</p>

<p>Athenian citizens were not allowed to marry
foreign women, even of reputation and virtue;
this law was not strictly observed: the penalty for
the violation of it was fixed at one thousand
drachms. Simo mentions the epithet <i lang="la">peregrina</i>, as
what Chremes said he had heard Glycera called;
but does not himself drop the slightest hint against
her, but, on the contrary, praises her modest demeanour;
as he must have been well aware, that
she did not deserve such an epithet, being her opposite
neighbour, and having seen her abroad:
<span lang="el">ξέναι</span>, or <dfn>strange women</dfn>, when they appeared in
public, were obliged to wear striped dresses, to
distinguish them from women of innocent conversation.</p>

<i>Of a wicked mind, one can expect nothing but

<p>In the Latin, <i lang="la">mala mens, malus animus</i>. It is
not easy to discriminate with accuracy the different
meanings the Romans attached to <i>mens</i> and <i>animus</i>.
Some think that <i>animus</i> meant the <dfn>heart</dfn>,
and <dfn>mens</dfn> the faculty of thinking. Grotius has, in
this passage, taken those words to signify <dfn>conscience</dfn>
and <dfn>judgment</dfn>: but, I think it probable,
that the word <i>animus</i> was usually employed when
they spoke of the <dfn>soul</dfn>, and that <dfn>mens</dfn> was intended
to express what we understand by the word <dfn>mind</dfn>,
when we speak of <dfn>greatness of mind</dfn>, or <dfn>littleness of
mind</dfn>. <i>Animus</i> was, perhaps, about equivalent to
that elegant expression,—<cite>instinctus divinitatis</cite>.</p>

<br>
<i>Exit Sosia.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“Here we take our last leave of Sosia, who is, in
the language of the commentators, a <dfn>protatick personage</dfn>,
that is, as Donatus explains it, one who
appears only once in the beginning (the <dfn>protasis</dfn>)
of the piece, for the sake of unfolding the argument,
and is never seen again in any part of the
play. The narration being ended, says Donatus,
the character of Sosia is no longer necessary. He
therefore departs, and leaves Simo alone to carry
on the action. With all due deference to the
ancients, I cannot help thinking this method, if too
constantly practised, as I think it is in our author,
rather inartificial. Narration, however beautiful,
is certainly the deadest part of theatrical compositions:
it is, indeed, strictly speaking, scarce dramatic,
and strikes the least in the representation:
and the too frequent introduction of a character,
to whom a principal person in the fable is to relate
in confidence the circumstances, previous to the
opening of the play, is surely too direct a manner of
conveying that information to the audience. Every
thing of this nature should come obliquely, fall in a
manner by accident, or be drawn as it were perforce,
from the parties concerned, in the course of
the action: a practice, which, if reckoned highly
beautiful in epic, may be almost set down as absolutely
necessary in dramatic poetry. It is, however,
more adviseable, even to seem tedious, than
to hazard being obscure. Terence certainly opens
his plays with great address, and assigns a probable
reason for one of the parties being so communicative
to the other; and yet it is too plain that
this narration is made merely for the sake of the
audience, since there never was a duller hearer
than Master Sosia, and it never appears, in the
sequel of the play, that Simo’s instructions to him
are of the least use to frighten Davus, or work upon
Pamphilus. Yet even this <dfn>protatick personage</dfn> is
one of the instances of Terence’s art, since it was
often used in the Roman comedy, as may be seen
even in Plautus, to make the relation of the argument
the express office of the prologue.”—<span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>

<p>Monsieur Baron does not dismiss Sosia here,
but brings him on the stage again; once in the
third act, and once in the fourth. Sir R. Steele
introduces Humphrey again in the first act, and
also in the fifth. We are told by Donatus, that in
the Andrian and Perinthian of Menander, which
are similar in the plot, the first scene is the same
as in Terence, but that in the Perinthian, the old
man consults with his wife instead of Sosia; and,
in the Andrian he opens with a soliloquy.</p>

<br>
<i>But, here he comes.</i><br>
</p>

<p>It has been objected against many dramatic
writers, that they are guilty of great neglect in first
bringing their characters on the stage, without preparing
the audience for their appearance, and acquainting
them with their names; and sometimes
it happens that an actor has been on the stage
a considerable time, before the audience know whom
he is meant to personate. Terence’s art is admirably
shown in this particular; a new character
scarcely ever appears on the stage after the first
scene, before his name, and character, and perhaps
what he may be expected to say or do, is announced
to the audience. For example, in the
Andrian, Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, Simo describes the occupation
and character of Davus before he appears;
and names him to the audience as he comes on the
stage. In Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, Davus introduces
Mysis: in Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, Mysis prepares the
audience for the appearance of Pamphilus: in Act
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, Simo announces Chremes, and
Mysis is the nomenclator of Crito in the last scene
of the fourth Act. This rule of preparation for
the next scene was called, among the ancients,
<span lang="el">παρασκευὴ</span>.</p>

<i>How this rascal prates!</i><br>
</p>

<p><span lang="la"><em>Carnifex</em> quæ loquitur.</span> <dfn>Carnifex</dfn>, or <dfn>carnufex</dfn>,
means literally an executioner: this was one of the
most opprobrious epithets used by the Romans.
Of all their public servants, the carnifex was the
lowest in rank: his office extended only to crucifixion,
which was never inflicted in Rome on any
but those who were considered as the very worst of
criminals. The person of the carnifex was held in
such abhorrence, that he was never suffered to reside
in Rome, and rarely (though sometimes) permitted
to enter the city. <cite>Vide Cicero’s Oration for
Rabirius.</cite> Carnifex means literally <dfn>a butcher</dfn>; and
most of the writers of later ages have used it in that
sense.</p>

<br>
<i>No: I am not Œdipus, but Davus.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This is as much as to say, <cite>I am a plain man, I
am no reader of riddles</cite>: because Œdipus, king of
Thebes, was particularly celebrated for solving an
enigma, which had long baffled the penetration of
all the Thebans. Ancient writers relate the story
thus: Europa, the sister of Cadmus, the first king
of Thebes, having been carried off by Jupiter; Juno,
in her jealousy, wreaked her vengeance on Europa’s
family, and persecuted Cadmus and his descendants
with the most inveterate hostility. During the
reign of Creon, one of the successors of Cadmus,
Juno sent to destroy Thebes, a dreadful monster,
called Sphinx, which was described as having the
face and voice of a woman, the wings of a dragon,
the body of a dog, and the claws of a lion. This
extraordinary monster dwelt in a cave, immediately
in the neighbourhood of Thebes, and seizing every
one that ventured to approach, proposed the following
well-known riddle, “<cite>What walks in the morning
on four legs, at noon on two, and at night on three?</cite>”
Those who were unable to solve the enigma were
instantly torn in pieces; and, as the Thebans were,
in general, so remarkable for their slowness and
sluggishness, that they were called “<cite>Theban pigs</cite>”
by the rest of Greece, it may be readily believed
that the monster’s question long remained unanswered.
When the city was in danger of total
demolition, Creon the king offered his daughter
Jocasta, and his crown, to him who should solve
the riddle, as the oracle declared that to be the
only means of deliverance. This was at last accomplished
by <cite>Œdipus</cite>, who replied, that it was
<em>man</em>: <cite>who crawls in his childhood, walks upright in
the vigour of his age, and who uses a crutch when he
grows old</cite>: on hearing this answer, the Sphinx slew
herself.</p>

<p>Some commentator on Terence very ingeniously
observes, that Davus, by saying that he is not
Œdipus, and cannot understand his riddle, covertly
insinuates that Simo is a second Sphinx.</p>

<i>The grinding-house.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Terence has rendered by the word <dfn>pistrinum</dfn>, the
Greek <span lang="el">σωφρονιστήριον</span>, or house of correction, whither
criminals were sent for the various terms of imprisonment
proportioned to their offences. Slaves,
while in this prison, were employed chiefly in
grinding corn, which, from a deficiency of mechanical
knowledge, was, in those times, a very laborious
employment. The Athenians, who were universally
celebrated for their kind and gentle treatment
of slaves, were very reluctant to proceed to
severer punishments than whipping or imprisonment:
but when a flagrant delinquency rendered it
necessary to make an example, they either burned
the criminal with a hot iron, in the offending member,
if possible; or put on his feet a torturing
instrument, called <span lang="el">χοῖνιξ</span>. If the law required the
criminal to suffer death, which happened in very
few cases, he was either hung, beaten to death
with clubs, or cast into a deep pit, called <span lang="el">βάραθρον</span>,
filled at the bottom with sharp spikes. They sometimes
had recourse to other extraordinary modes
of punishment: but the before-mentioned were the
most common.</p>

<i>In truth, friend Davus, from what I have just

<p>This scene contains the second part of the narration,
which possesses all the requisites enumerated
by Cicero, <cite>perspicuity, probability, brevity,
and sweetness</cite>. It is introduced with Terence’s
usual art, and enough is said respecting Glycera’s
birth, to prepare the mind for the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> in
the last act. This scene, and that before it, are
omitted in the Conscious Lovers; and a dialogue
between Humphrey and Tom, and another between
Tom and Phyllis, the English Davus and Mysis,
are substituted instead of them: but Phyllis is the
servant of Lucinda, the lady Sir J. Bevil wishes
his son to marry: and not of Indiana, the modern
Glycera. The two scenes above mentioned contain
only one incident: the conveyance of a letter
from young Bevil to Lucinda, apprizing her of his
disinclination to the match.</p>

<i>If he finds out the least thing I am undone.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Terence has the art of making us feel interested
in the favour of almost all his characters: they
insensibly gain ground in our good opinion: even
this Davus, who certainly has a spice of the rogue
about him, creates a warm interest in his favour by
his fidelity to Pamphilus; and his generosity in
risking his own safety to serve him: he braves the
threats of Simo, when, by assisting him, and betraying
Pamphilus, he must have secured the old
man’s favour, and consequently great advantages
to himself. But very few of the worst characters in
Terence’s plays seem to us to be wholly unamiable.</p>

<i>Boy or girl, say they, the child shall be brought up.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In the Latin,</p>

<p class="center" lang="la">
Quidquid peperisset decreverunt tollere.<br>
</p>

<p>Boy or girl, they have resolved that it shall be
<em>taken up</em>. The words <em>taken up</em> allude to the custom
which prevailed in Greece, of destroying children.
This barbarous cruelty was practised on
various pretences; if an infant was, at its birth,
deformed in any of its members, or if it appeared
extremely feeble or sickly, the laws allowed, and
even enjoined, that it should be exposed: sometimes
illegitimacy was considered a sufficient cause
for the exposure of a child. Though the parents
were generally allowed to choose whether their
offspring should be destroyed or preserved; in
some parts of Greece all the inhabitants were compelled
to send their new-born infants to officers
appointed to examine them: who, if they found
them not robust and healthy, cast them immediately
into deep caverns, called <span lang="el">ἀποθέται</span>, which were dedicated
to this purpose. It was customary, in
Athens, to place a new-born infant on the ground
at the feet of its father, if he then took it up in his
arms, it was considered that he bound himself to
educate and provide for the child: hence, the expression
<dfn>tollere</dfn>, <dfn>to take up</dfn>: but, if on the contrary,
he refused to acknowledge it, a person appointed
for that purpose conveyed it to some desert place at
a distance from the city: and there left it to perish.
The Thebans are said to have been the only people
in Greece, among whom this barbarous custom did
not prevail: but the story of Œdipus, a prince who
was exposed, though afterwards preserved, is a
proof that they did not altogether abstain from this
practice.</p>

<i>To prove that she is a citizen of Athens.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Women were allowed to enjoy the privileges of
Athenian citizens, and, at the building of Athens,
by Cecrops, they carried a point of no less importance
than the choice of a name for the new city,
in opposition to the votes of the men. Varro tells
us that <em>Neptune</em> wished the new-built city to be
called after his name, and that <em>Athena</em>, or <em>Minerva</em>,
rivalled his pretensions. The question being
put by Cecrops to his people, the men all voted for
<em>Neptune</em>, but the women voted for <em>Minerva</em>, and
gained, by one vote, the privilege of naming the
city. The women were wholly excluded from any
share in the government of Athens, in later ages;
though they still retained various privileges as
Athenian citizens.</p>

</p>

<p>The title of <em>merchant</em> we are to suppose to be
added by Davus to embellish the tale. Neither
Chremes nor Phania are described as <em>merchants</em>.
This addition is well managed by the author, as
Davus, who thought the whole a fabrication, imagined
he was more likely to gain credit by telling
the tale that way; as a considerable traffick was
carried on between Athens and the island of Andros,
which was a very fertile spot.</p>

<p>M. Baron has translated this scene with great
fidelity and beauty. Davus developes in it a plan
to break off the dreaded match with Philumena, by
introducing Glycera to Chremes: which incident
is substituted instead of the birth of the child.
There is a break in the French lines which renders
them inimitably beautiful.</p>

<i>Well, I’ll betake myself to the Forum.</i><br>

<p>A forum, both in Athens and Rome, was a large
open space within the city, dedicated to various
purposes. The forum was a place where the people
met for <em>public worship</em>, for <em>the administration of
justice</em>, and to debate on the <em>public affairs</em>. In the
Forum, also, were the <em>temples</em>, <em>hospitals</em>, <em>sanctuaries</em>,
and the <em>markets of all kinds</em>: in short, it
was a place of general rendezvous for men of all
ranks and professions, and was, in many respects,
very similar to those places of meeting we call by
the name <em>Exchange</em>.</p>

<p>In Rome there were six great forums, 1. the
Roman, 2. the Julian, 3. the Augustan, 4. the
Palladian, 5. the Trojan, 6. the Forum of Sallust.
In Athens, the principal Forum was called <span lang="el">ἀρχαία
ἀγορὰ</span>; it was extremely spacious, and decorated
with some very fine buildings, and statues of eminent
persons. There were also many others, but the
most considerable was called <em>the Forum</em>, by way

<i>Act</i> <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <i>Scene</i> <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr><br>
</p>

<p>Of all writers ancient or modern, except Seneca,
Terence was the most indefatigable in endeavouring
to embellish his writings with all the ornaments
that <em>alliteration</em> could give them. It is not my
intention to enter in this place into a discussion of
the advantages, or disadvantages that verses may
derive from alliteration; a subject on which critics
differ as widely as they can on any other point.
The practice of many first-rate writers, however,
both ancient and modern, who have thought that
alliteration adorned their compositions, entitles it
to attention. Although eminent critics have argued
against this literary ornament, that its success is
but a trivial excellence, I cannot but remark that
it is allowed on all sides that great labour, care,
and patience, are requisite, to succeed in alliteration;
which must certainly contribute to render it of
some value, and afford an absolute proof of the excessive
labour and deliberation with which Terence
wrote his plays, every line of which was, as I may
say, weighed, before he wrote it down: for no
author, ancient or modern, (with the before-mentioned
exception,) ever employed alliteration so
frequently, nor, in my opinion, with better effect
than Terence.</p>

<p>The following lines will afford the reader a specimen
of the almost astonishing extent to which alliteration
was used by some of the ancient authors,
Greek and Latin.</p>

<i>However, I’ll bring her.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke makes this speech come from Archillis,
and writes it thus: <i lang="la">Tamen eam adduce</i>, <i>I
say, fetch her</i>. This reading is taken from Guyetus:
but Dr. Bentley objects to Archillis within calling to
Mysis without. But as Mysis uses the expression
<dfn>importunitatem</dfn> <span class="allsmcap">SPECTATE</span> <i>aniculæ</i>, <i>see</i> the old woman’s
importunity, and not <em>audite</em> importunitatem,
<em>hear</em>, &amp;c.: we must suppose Archillis to show her
impatience by gestures, as she stood at the door of
Glycera’s house.</p>

<i>Mark, how importunate this old baggage is.</i><br>
</p>

<p><span lang="la">Importunitatem spectate <em>aniculæ</em>.</span> <dfn>Anicula</dfn> is a
word of singular derivation, and signifies literally a
sorceress; being compounded of two Latin words,
one signifying <dfn>an old woman</dfn>, and the other <dfn>to howl</dfn>:
because sorceresses always <em>howled</em> when they made
their incantations. We must not suppose that
Mysis here meant to call Archillis a sorceress, but
merely used the word above mentioned as a term of
reproach. According to Antonius Magnus, the
<em>aniculæ</em> were not a little mischievous, as he proposes
to shew by the following quotation: <span lang="la">“Retulit
Leonardus Varius, lib. <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> de Fascino, multas hac
nostra tempestate existere <em>aniculas</em>, quarum impuritate
non paucos effascinari pueros, illosque non
modo in gravissimum incidere discrimen, verum
atque acerbam sæpissime subire mortem. Pecudes

<i>Well, may Diana grant my poor mistress</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The common reading of this passage is, <span class="smcap">Di</span> <i lang="la">date

rather imagine that Terence wrote, <span class="smcap">Diana</span> <i lang="la">da facultatem</i>,
<em>May</em> <span class="smcap">Diana</span> <em>grant</em>, &amp;c., because, on these
occasions, the Greeks never invoked the assistance
of all the gods, but usually requested the help of
Diana, as Glycera does afterwards, when she calls
upon her by the name of Juno Lucina, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_143">Note

in childbirth, and was called <span lang="el">Εἰλείθυια</span>.</p>

<abbr title="Act One Scene Five"><i>A.</i> I. <i>S.</i> V.</abbr> <i>Pamphilus, Mysis.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This scene contains the third and last part of the
narration, which is entirely pathetic, and its length
is very artificially and successfully relieved by the
figure called by the Greeks <span lang="el">προσωποποια</span>, which is
introduced with so many moving and pathetic
graces, as afford ample proof that Terence was as
great a master of the passions, as even Trabea,
Attilius, and Cæcilius themselves, who were so
highly extolled by the ancients for their excellence
in compositions of that nature. Terence has admirably
relieved the necessary length of his narration
in this play, by his judicious method of dividing it:
the first part is serious, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_65">Note 65</a>,) and raises
our curiosity: the second part is comic, (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#note_89">Note 89</a>,) and excites our laughter; the third part
is pathetic, and moves our pity. The lines in
which Pamphilus describes the death of Chrysis
are so extremely moving, that some of the most
eminent critics have considered them at least equal,
if not superior, to all attempts in the pathetic
both ancient and modern. The finest passage in
M. Baron’s Andrienne is, (in my opinion,) his imitation
of the before-mentioned speech of Pamphilus:
and the inimitable beauty which so much
strikes us in the <em>French copy</em> ought to impress us
with a just idea of the splendid merit of the <em>Latin
original</em>.</p>

<p>The whole speech is too long to be inserted here,

<br>
<i>And why has Chremes changed his mind.</i><br>
<br>
<span lang="la">“Id mutavit, quoniam me <span class="allsmcap">IMMUTATUM</span> videt.”</span></p>

<p>The verb <i lang="la">immutare</i> in other Latin authors, and
even in other parts of Terence himself, signifies <dfn>to
change</dfn>; as in the Phormio, Antipho says, <i lang="la">Non possum</i>
immutarier. I cannot <dfn>be changed</dfn>. But here,
the sense absolutely requires that <i lang="la">immutatum</i>
should be rendered <dfn>not changed</dfn>. Madame Dacier
endeavours to reconcile this, according to a conjecture
of her father’s, by shewing that <i lang="la">immutatum</i>
stands for <dfn>immutabilis</dfn>, as <i lang="la">immotus</i> for <dfn>immobilis</dfn>,
<i lang="la">invictus</i> for <dfn>invincibilis</dfn>, &amp;c. But these examples
do not remove the difficulty; since those participles
always bear a negative sense, which <i lang="la">immutatus</i> does
not: and thence arises all the difficulty. Terence
certainly uses the verb <i lang="la">immutare</i> both negatively
and positively, as is plain from this passage, and
the above passage in the Phormio: and I dare say,
with strict propriety. In our own language, we
have instances of the same word bearing two senses,
directly opposite to each other. The word <em>let</em>, for
instance, is used in the contradictory meanings of
<dfn>permission</dfn> and <dfn>prohibition</dfn>. The modern acceptation
of the word is indeed almost entirely confined to
the first sense; though we say, even at this day,
<cite>without let or molestation</cite>. Shakspeare, in Hamlet,
says,</p>

<p class="center">
‘I’ll make a ghost of him that <em>lets</em> me;’<br>
</p>

<p>“That is, <em>stops</em>, <em>prevents</em>, <em>hinders</em> me, which is
directly opposite to the modern use of the word.”—<span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Immutare</i> always signifies to <dfn>change</dfn>, <i lang="la">immutatus</i>
therefore cannot mean <em>unchanged</em>: we see,
moreover, that Pamphilus has been all along in
love with Glycera, and that he never for a moment
entertained the slightest idea of forsaking her.
This passage was very difficult; but my father has
made it easy, by shewing that <i lang="la">immutatus</i> is put for
<i lang="la">immutabilis</i>, and that composed adjectives, which
are derived from passive participles, do not always
express what is <em>done</em>, but sometimes what <em>may be
done</em>; that is to say, they become potentials. For
example, <i lang="la">immotus</i> for <dfn>immobilis</dfn>, <i lang="la">infectus</i> for <dfn>what
cannot be done</dfn>, <i lang="la">invictus</i> for <dfn>invincibilis</dfn>, <i lang="la">invisus</i> for
<dfn>invisibilis</dfn>, <i lang="la">indomitus</i> for <dfn>indomabilis</dfn>, thus <i lang="la">immutatus</i>
is for <dfn>immutabilis</dfn>.”—<span class="smcap">Madame Dacier.</span></p>

<p>The reader will judge whether the arguments used
by these two learned and ingenious critics, will
justify them in translating <i lang="la">immutatus</i> in a sense
directly <dfn>opposite</dfn> to its usual meaning, in the writings
of Cicero, and the most learned of the Roman
authors. With all the respect which is unquestionably
due to the pre-eminent talents of Madame
Dacier and Mr. Colman, I am inclined to believe
that the sense of this passage is made more clear by
the reading I have adopted. If we allow their
arguments to be of force, we must translate the
sentence thus, <dfn>is Chremes changed because he sees
that I am unchanged</dfn>. But if we allow <i lang="la">immutatus</i> to
retain its usual signification, the sentence must be
read thus, <cite>is he changed because he sees that I am
changed</cite>: i.&nbsp;e., <em>because I, who had so high a character
for prudence, am changed, and by my connexion
with Glycera have proved that I am imprudent</em>.
It is, in short, as if he said, Chremes has
changed his mind once on account of my connexion
with Glycera, and now, I suppose, he changes it
again for the same wise reason. This would not,
(in my opinion,) be an unnatural expression for an
impatient man: and the sequel of the same speech
seems to favour this interpretation.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>I shrewdly suspect that this daughter of Chremes is
either hideously ugly, or that something is amiss
in her.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the Latin <i lang="la">aliquid monstri alunt</i>, <dfn>they breed up
some monster</dfn>.</p>

<p>This expression took its rise from the custom of
exposing and destroying monstrous and deformed
children, (<i>see <a href="#note_93">Note 93</a></i>) which was required by
law: therefore, those parents who resolved, notwithstanding,
to educate a child of that kind, were
compelled to do so with the utmost secrecy: hence,
the phrase “<i lang="la">alere monstrum</i>,” <dfn>to breed up a monster</dfn>,
was used in Rome, to express any thing done
in great secrecy. Terence has, by no means, violated
probability, in representing Pamphilus as
unacquainted with the person of Philumena:
<em>though she had been contracted to him</em>; as Grecian
women very seldom appeared abroad, and never,
unveiled: and it not unfrequently occurred, that
the bridegroom was introduced to the bride for the
<em>first time</em> on the day of marriage.</p>

<i>She is in labour.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In the Latin, <i lang="la">Laborat e dolore</i>. Cooke thinks
that these words mean merely <dfn>she is weighed down
by grief</dfn>: and argues, that if Pamphilus had understood
her words in any other sense, he would
have urged her to more haste; as he does, when
she tells him that she is going for a midwife. But
<i lang="la">laboro</i> sometimes means to strive or struggle, as in
<cite>Ovid</cite>,</p>

(<cite>Act <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></cite>) that Glycera was possessed of the property
of Chrysis, which we are to imagine, from
what Crito says concerning it, to have been something
considerable. I believe <i lang="la">egestate</i> is often put
for want of any kind. It may appear somewhat
enigmatical, that Terence should speak of the liberal
and virtuous education of Glycera, by such a
person as Chrysis was said to have been; but it is
a circumstance in no wise repugnant to the manners
of the Greeks; as we see in the Eunuch in the
instance of <i>Thais</i> and <i>Pamphila</i>.</p>

considered these aërial beings as of a nature between
that of gods and men: and that they communicated
to the latter the will of the former by
oracles, dreams, <i>&amp;c.</i> Apuleius takes the genius
to be the same as the lar and larva: but it is most

<i>Charinus, Byrrhia.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“These two characters were not in the works of
Menander, but were added to the fable by Terence,
lest Philumena’s being left without a husband, on
the marriage of Pamphilus to Glycerium should
appear too <em>tragical</em> a circumstance.—<span class="smcap">Donatus.</span></p>

<p>Madame Dacier, after transcribing this remark
adds, that it appears to her to be an observation of
great importance to the theatre, and well worthy
our attention.</p>

<p>Important as this dramatic arcanum may be, it
were to be wished, that Terence had never found
it out, or, at least, that he had not availed himself
of it in the construction of the Andrian. It is
plain that the duplicity of the intrigue did not proceed
from the imitation of Menander, since these
characters, on which the double plot is founded,
were not drawn from the Greek poet. Charinus
and Byrrhia are indeed but poor counterparts, or
faint shadows of Pamphilus and Davus; and, instead
of adding life and vigour to the fable, rather
damp its spirit, and stop the activity of its progress.
As to the tragical circumstance of Philumena’s
having no husband, it seems something like the
distress of Prince Prettyman<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, who thinks it a
matter of indifference, whether he shall appear to
be the son of a king or a fisherman, and is only
uneasy lest he should be the son of nobody at all.
I am much more inclined to the opinion of an ingenious
French critic, whom I have already cited
more than once, than to that of Donatus or Madame
Dacier. His comment in this underplot is
as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<cite>It is almost impossible to conduct two intrigues
at a time without weakening the interest of both.
With what address has Terence interwoven the
amours of Pamphilus and Charinus in the Andrian!
But has he done it without inconvenience? At the
beginning of the second act, do we not seem to be
entering upon a new piece? and does the fifth conclude
in a very interesting manner?</cite>”—<span class="smcap">Diderot.</span></p>

<p>It is but justice to Sir Richard Steele to confess,
that he has conducted the under-plot in the Conscious
Lovers in a much more artful and interesting
manner than Terence in the play before us. The
part which Myrtle sustains (though not wholly unexceptionable,
especially the last act,) is more
essential to the fable than Charinus in the Andrian.
His character also is more separated and distinguished
from Bevil, than Charinus from Pamphilus,
and serves to produce one of the best scenes<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> in the
play.” <span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>

<i>Byrrhia.—I beseech you, O Charinus.</i><br>
</p>

<p><cite lang="la">Quæso ædepol</cite>, Charine. <dfn>Ædepol</dfn> means literally
by the temple of Pollux, being an abbreviation of
the words per templum Pollucis, as <dfn>pol</dfn> was used for
per Pollucem: and <dfn>hercle</dfn> for per Herculem. These
ancient expletives are of a similar nature to those in
modern use, which are almost all of religious derivation.</p>

<p>To affirm a thing by the temple of Pollux, was a
very common expression among the ancients; and
is frequently used in the plays of Terence, where it
seems to have been particularly the oath of slaves.
It was natural enough that Athenian slaves should
asseverate by this temple, as it was the place where
they were bought and sold by the inhabitants of
Attica. This splendid building, which was so
unworthily employed, was situated in the <span lang="el">κάτω
πόλις</span>, or the lower city, towards the sea; and was
called <span lang="el">Ἀνάκειον</span>, because Castor and Pollux were
called <span lang="el">ἄνακες</span>. In the Greek mythology, Castor and
Pollux were the twin sons of Leda: their father,
Jupiter, rewarded their virtues, by giving them a
place in the heavens, where they are called Gemini.
They were supposed to preside over martial exercises,
(for their skill in which they were particularly
eminent,) and they had the power of allaying
storms. These fables have caused the names of
Castor and Pollux to be given to that well-known
meteor which sometimes appears at sea in the
shape of several fire-balls, which seem to adhere to
the vessel, and which are judged to indicate an
approaching calm. This phænomenon is called by
the French, Spaniards, and Italians, San Elmo, or
Hermo.</p>

<p>Terence always admirably preserves the characters
of domestics, in the style of the advice they
give their masters, which is very often conveyed in
some trite adage, or formal apothegm. This is
another instance of our author’s art. Want of attention
to the dialogue of the inferior characters, is
a frequent fault among dramatic writers; and often
proves hostile to the success of a piece, particularly
of a comedy, where it is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Madame Dacier observes, with her usual judgment,
that Terence simplifies a philosophical maxim
in so elegant and familiar a manner, that it assumes
a grace, even from the lips of a domestic. Diderot
makes a similar remark in the Preface to his
Père de Famille; which he probably remembered
from the learned lady before mentioned. Montaigne

speech. <span lang="fr">C’est <em>foiblesse</em> de ceder aux maux, mais

</p>

<p>Though Charinus means, that the misery of losing
Philumena would cost him his life, as he expressly
tells Davus in the next scene, yet he only insinuates
this by saying, You will never see me again:
and avoids the mention of <em>death</em>: which was considered
among the Greeks as a word that should
scarcely ever be named: and it was reckoned the
height of ill breeding to discourse in company
respecting human mortality; which was a subject
to be spoken of only by distant hints: (<i>vide <a href="#note_190">Note
190</a></i>.) This whole scene is admirably written; and
as well as the last scene in the first act, is a specimen
of Terence’s powers in the pathetic. Some
very ingenious remarks on this scene are to be
found in Donatus, and in the Miscellanies of
Nonnius.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Charinus and Byrrhia set
any stratagem on foot, in compliance with the
wishes of Pamphilus, to break off the treaty between
Simo and Chremes; indeed, they are rather
inactive throughout the play, and the under-plot
proceeds separately from the principal plot: this,
I attribute to Terence’s close imitation of Menander,
in what respects Pamphilus’s intrigue, as the
characters of Charinus and Byrrhia were added by
Terence: Menander’s play being written with a single
plot; which was doubled by our author, in compliance
with the taste of his age. It is supposed
that Terence’s reputation for art was gained chiefly
by his success in combining two intrigues in one
play: a mode of dramatic writing which the Romans
in those times considered a great novelty.
The Stepmother is the only play written by Terence,
in which the plot is single, and though critics in
general argue with Volcatius,</p>

<p class="center small" lang="la">
“Sumetur <cite>Hecyra sexta</cite> ex his fabula,”<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">that it is not equal to the rest of his productions,
many persons, very eminent for their judgment,
have attributed the superiority of the other five
plays, to the advantages they possess over the
Stepmother, both in portraiture of character, and
in the conduct of the catastrophe, and of the fable
in general, rather than to any additional attraction
which they can derive from a double plot. The
Carin and Byrrhie of M. Baron, are, in every respect,
the counterparts of the Charinus and Byrrhia
of Terence; but Sir R. Steele has very much enlivened
the character of Charinus; his Myrtle is
one of the most entertaining personages in the
piece. <i>Vide</i> Notes <a href="#note_108">108</a>, <a href="#note_159">159</a>, <a href="#note_162">162</a>, <a href="#note_163">163</a>.</p>

<i>Not a soul do I see before the door.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The marriage ceremonies of the Greeks were, in
many respects, very similar to those of the Romans.
In Athens, as at Rome, sacrifices were
deemed necessary preliminaries to the celebration
of a marriage: and the bride, accompanied by
bride-women, whom the Latins called <dfn>pronubæ</dfn>, the
Greeks <span lang="el">νυμφεύτριαι</span>, was conducted to her husband’s
house with great ceremony; if the parties were of
rank, the bride’s train was increased by the attendance
of many of her friends and relatives, who
previously assembled at her father’s house. It is
to the absence of the bride’s train, and of the musicians
who usually assembled before her door, and
attended her to her new habitation, that Davus
alludes, when he says, that he could perceive no
company in the house, or before the door. For

Greeks and Romans, <i>vide</i> Notes <a href="#note_70">70</a>, <a href="#note_75">75</a>, <a href="#note_76">76</a>, <a href="#note_117">117</a>,

<i>Every thing is quite still and quiet.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Cecrops, the first king of Athens, seems to have
been the reputed founder of marriage-ceremonies
among the Greeks: the Athenians accounted it so
dishonourable to grow old in a single state, that
their laws peremptorily required, that all the
<span lang="el">αὐτοκράτορες, στρατηγοὶ, πολέμαρχοι</span>, and <span lang="el">ταξίαρχοι</span>, who
were the principal military officers, also the <span lang="el">ἄρχοντες</span>
and <span lang="el">ἱεροφύλακες</span>, or chief priests, as well as the
archons and other chief magistrates, should be
chosen from the married men only.</p>

<p>Numerous ceremonies were always performed at
Grecian marriages, many of which were performed
at the house of the bride, and in procession from it:
it is exceedingly well managed by Terence, that
Davus should discover Simo’s stratagem, by finding
Chremes’ house “quite still and quiet,” because the
house of a bride was generally full of noisy company.
The following extracts from a learned
writer on antiquities will afford some valuable
information respecting the Greek marriages.</p>

<p>“The Athenian virgins were presented to Diana
before it was lawful for them to marry. This ceremony,
which was performed at Brauron, an Athenian
borough, was called <span lang="el">ἀρκτεία</span>. There was also
another custom for virgins, when they became marriageable,
to present certain baskets, full of little
curiosities, to Diana, to obtain permission to leave
her train, and to change their state of life. Indeed
we find Diana concerned in the preparatory solemnities
before all marriages; for a married state being
her aversion, it was thought necessary for all who
entered upon it, to ask her pardon for dissenting
from her. The ancient Athenians paid the same
honour to Heaven and Earth, which were believed
to have a particular concern in marriages, of which
they were thought a proper emblem. (<cite>Procl. in
Timæ. Platon. Comment. 5.</cite>) The fates and graces
being supposed to join, and afterwards to preserve
the tie of love, were partakers of the same respect.
(<cite>Pol. <abbr title="liber">lib.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter"><i>cap.</i></abbr> 3.) Before the marriage could
be solemnized, the other gods were consulted, and
their assistance also implored by prayers and sacrifices.
When the victim was opened, the gall was
taken out and thrown behind the altar, as being
the seat of anger and revenge, and therefore the
aversion of all the deities who superintended the
affairs of love. The married persons, with their
attendants, were richly adorned, according to their
rank. The house, in which the nuptials were celebrated,
was also decorated with garlands. (<abbr title="Hierocles in fragment"><cite>Hierocl.
in Frag.</cite></abbr> <span lang="el">περὶ γάμον</span>; <abbr title="Stobaeus sermon 186"><cite>Stob. Serm. 186</cite></abbr>, <cite>Senec. Thebaid.
v. 507</cite>;) a pestle was tied upon the door, (<cite>Poll.
lib.</cite> III. <cite>cap.</cite> 3. <cite>seg.</cite> 37;) and a maid carried a
sieve, (<i>Id. ibid.</i>) the bride herself bearing <span lang="el">φρύγετον,
φρύγετρον</span>, or <span lang="el">φρύγητρον</span>, which was an earthen vessel,
in which barley was parched, (<cite>Poll. lib.</cite> I. <cite>cap.</cite> 12.
<cite>seg.</cite> 246; <cite><abbr title="Hesychius">Hesych.</abbr></cite>) and which was intended to signify
her obligation to attend to the business of a
family. The bride was usually conducted in a
chariot from her father’s to her husband’s house in
the evening. She was placed in the middle, her
husband sitting on one side, and, on the other, one
of his most intimate friends, who was called <span lang="el">πάροχος</span>.
They were sometimes accompanied by bands of
musicians and dancers, (<abbr title="Homer Iliad s. verse 491"><cite>Hom. Il. <span lang="el">σʹ</span>. v. 491.</cite></abbr>) The
song with which they were entertained on the road
was called <span lang="el">ἁρμάτειον μέλος</span>, from <span lang="el">ἅρμα</span>, the coach in
which they rode, and the axle-tree of which they
burned as soon as they arrived at the end of their
journey; thereby signifying that the bride was never
to return to her father’s house. The day of the
bride’s leaving her father was celebrated in the
manner of a festival, which was distinct from the
nuptial solemnity, which was kept at the bride-groom’s
house, and began at evening, the usual
time of the bride’s arrival.”—<span class="smcap">Robinson’s</span> <cite>Archæologia
Græca</cite>.</p>

<i>But can see no bridemaid.</i><br>
</p>

<p><span lang="la">Matronam nullam</span>: Some commentators think
that matrona and pronuba have a similar meaning;
but though it is clear that both those words were
used to describe females who attended the bride at
a Roman marriage, I am inclined to believe that
they have each a distinct signification. The Latin
poets used matrona as a name for all married women
without distinction: thus, Horace evidently
speaks of wives in general, when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza" lang="la">

    <div class="verse indent0">The matron muffled in her modest stole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will scarce allow her features to be seen.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">because married women only were allowed to wear
the <dfn>stola</dfn>, a large robe which covered the person
from head to foot. Matrons were distinguished as
follows, <span lang="la">matronas appellabant, quibus <em>stolas habendi</em>
jus erat</span>: those only were called matrons,
whose rank entitled them to wear the stola, (<cite>Alex.
ab. Alex. lib. 5. cap. 18.</cite>) as women of inferior rank
wore the instita. The pronubæ were always chosen
from those women who had been married only once;
and it appears that a bride had several pronubæ to
attend her, but only one matrona. Terence says
nullam matronam, whereas the pronubæ were
spoken of as being four or five in number. I think
it not unlikely that the first in rank of the pronubæ
was chosen to preside over the rest of the bridemaids,
and to attend immediately on the person of
the bride, whence she was called matrona pronubarum,
the chief of the bridemaids. Servius thinks
that matrona was used to designate a woman who
had one child: and thus distinguished from the
mater-familias who had several. But Aulus Gellius
is of opinion that all married women were called
matronæ, whether they had any children or not.
Thus Ovid, speaking of Hersilia, the wife of Romulus,
who had no offspring, calls her matrona.</p>

<i>All was silent.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Nil tumulti. Terence here compares guests,
called together in a hurry, to soldiers raised on
any sudden emergency of great importance. As no
marriage had been thought of till that day, <em>if</em>
Chremes <em>had</em> invited any guests, they could have
had scarcely an hour’s notice; Davus, therefore,
aptly calls such a hasty assemblage tumultus,
which word was used to signify a very quick muster
of soldiers on any pressing occasion, when all that
took arms were called tumultuarii. (<i>Vide</i> <abbr title="Livy, One">Liv. I.</abbr>
37, 35.) Numerous allusions of this kind, which
abound in the writings of Terence, cannot be happily
preserved in a translation.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Besides all this, as I was returning, I met Chremes’
servant, who was carrying home some herbs, and
as many little fishes for the old man’s supper, as
might have cost an obolus.</i></p>

<p>What a supper for a man of fortune! as we
must suppose Chremes to have been, since he
could give Glycera and Philumena each a dowry of
ten talents. The Athenians were remarkable, <em>even
to a proverb</em>, for their extreme frugality. To tell a
person that he lived <span lang="el">ἀττικηρῶς</span> or like an Athenian,
was to tell him in other words that he lived penuriously.
The food of the common people was very
coarse; being such as they could procure at a
slight expense. <span lang="el">Mάζα</span>, a very common food among
them, was a mixture of meal, salt, water, and oil:
and another, called <span lang="el">μυττωτὸν</span>, was a composition of
garlick, eggs, and milk. Many of those who
drank water, drank it warm; as the water of the
hot fountains, (of which there are many in Greece,)
was reckoned highly restorative. This simple diet,
however, soon gave place to greater delicacies, and,
in Greece, as in all other countries, refinement and
luxury kept pace with each other. For the value of
an obolus, see the table of money in <a href="#note_208">Note 208</a>.
An obolus worth of food was, probably, as much as
would furnish a coarse meal for one person. Plutarch
tells us, that the Athenian women were forbidden,
by law, to travel with more food than could
be purchased with an obolus: this harsh law must
have been formed with a view to prevent them from
making any long stay abroad. <i>Vide</i> Notes <a href="#note_71">71</a>,

<p><span lang="la">Nisi vides, nisi senis amicos oras, <em>ambis</em>.</span> The
meaning of ambis in this line is very equivocal;
ambire means to solicit, and also to run round.
Some commentators give ambis the same sense
with oras: but that makes Davus’s speech incomplete.
I have seen an attempt to support this
reading by making Pamphilus speak the word ambis,
with which he breaks in upon Davus. The
learned reader will judge what degree of attention
ought to be paid to this reading; I have adopted
that which seemed to me to be most agreeable to
the sense. If frustra had been added, the line
would have been more intelligible. Ambit has much
the same meaning in the following passage,</p>

<i>Glycera, moreover, is destitute and friendless.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Terence here alludes to the Athenian law, which
compelled all sojourners in Athens to choose a
patron and protector: we must suppose that Glycera
had neglected that ceremony after Chrysis’
death. Davus insinuates that it would afford Simo
a sufficient pretext to drive her from the city. If a
suit at law, called <span lang="el">ἀποστασίου δίκη</span>, was instituted
against a sojourner in the before-mentioned circumstances:
all the offender’s property was confiscated
to public use.</p>

<p>Banishment, among the Athenians, was of three
kinds, 1. <span lang="el">φυγὴ</span>, temporary exile, the length of which
was fixed by the judges. 2. <span lang="el">Ὀστρακισμὸς</span>, ten years’
banishment, during which the exile was allowed to
receive the proceeds of his estate. 3. <span lang="el">ἀειφυγία</span>, perpetual
banishment. The last kind was chiefly inflicted
on murderers, the second on men, who
grew so extremely popular and powerful as to endanger
the security of a republican government.
Mr. Cooke thinks, with Dr. Bentley, that “the original
of this passage should be read, <span lang="la">eam <em>eiciat</em>
oppido,</span>” instead of <span lang="la"><em>eam ejiciat</em> oppido</span>: he supports
this reading by the following quotation,</p>

<p>It is impossible to ascertain, beyond a doubt,
what Terence meant to express by these lines, and
the most ingenious critics have differed entirely respecting
their true signification. Some think this
sentence should be interpreted thus: Be careful not
to discontinue your visits to Glycera, lest Chremes
should think you have broken off your connexion
with her, and change his mind in consequence, and
resolve to give you his daughter. In short, <em>don’t
quit your intrigue, and reform, lest Chremes should
hear of it, and give you Philumena</em>: among those
who read the words in this sense, the most eminent
are <cite>Bernard, Echard, M. Baron, the authors of the
old Paris edition of 1671, and of the old English
edition with notes</cite>. At the head of those who have
adopted a contrary interpretation are <cite>Cooke</cite>, <cite>Colman</cite>,
and <cite>Madame Dacier</cite>, who translate the lines
thus, <dfn>Let not the fear of Chremes’ changing his
mind, and resolving to give you his daughter, make
you hesitate in doing this</dfn>, i.&nbsp;e., in telling your father
that you’ll marry. I have adopted the latter translation,
which seems more pertinent to the subject
on which Davus and Pamphilus were conversing.
The word hæc, moreover, usually refers to something
immediately present, as was the topic of
Pamphilus consenting to the marriage to deceive
Simo. Terence, I think, if he had intended to
allude to the visits, letters, <i>&amp;c.</i>, to Glycera, would
have used the word isthæc. I conclude this note
with the opinion of Madame Dacier respecting this
passage, which that learned lady translates as
<span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p lang="fr">“<i>Car que Chremès ne veuille pas vous donner sa fille,
cela est hors de doute. Gardez vous donc bien que la
crainte qu’il ne change de sentiment, et ne veuille que
vous soyez bon gendre, ne vous fasse changer quelque
chose au conseil que je vous ai donné.</i></p>

<p>This passage is extremely difficult. I have been
obliged to take a little latitude to make it clear.
I shall explain the words literally: <span lang="la">Nec tu ea
causa minueris hæc quæ facis, ne is mutet suam
sententiam</span>. This is the construction, <span lang="la">nec tu minueris
hæc quæ facis, ea causa ne is mutet suam

you are going to do; that is to say, what I advise
you to do: <span lang="la">ea causa</span>; on this pretext; <span lang="la">ne is mutet

should change his mind: <span lang="la">minuere</span>, to diminish, is

<p class="hanging"><i>As to the hopes you indulge, that no man will give
his daughter to you, on account of this imprudent
connexion that you have formed; I will soon convince
you of their fallacy.</i></p>

<p>We must not suppose, that the sentiments of
Pamphilus were really such as Davus here insinuates:
this would be representing him as an unblushing
profligate; who, because he was disinclined to
marriage, wished his character to be so very black,
that no reputable family in Athens would admit him
as a son-in-law: for this is the sense of what Davus
says, though I have rather softened his expression.
Whoever attentively peruses what Simo says of his
son, (in Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>) must perceive how inconsistent
such a wish must be with the character of
Pamphilus. Madame Dacier observes very aptly
on a similar expression of Sosia, “<i lang="fr">les valets
prennent toujours tout du mauvais côte</i>, slaves always
look on the dark side of every thing. In respect to
the <em>before-mentioned passage</em>, I am rather inclined to
the opinion of a late ingenious commentator, who
speaks of it as follows:</p>

<p>“Mr. Davus talks here as if he did not know
what to say. In my humble opinion, these four
lines are no ornaments to the scene:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nam quod tu speras, Propulsabo facile: uxorem his moribus</div>

<p>Pamphilus, in this sentence, says <span lang="la">pollicitus

which cannot be gracefully expressed in English.
Pollicitatio, writes a learned commentator, <span lang="la">magnarum

something promised over and over again, after

<p>Dr. Bentley thinks that this line ought to be omitted

who had not quitted the stage at all, from the
time of Charinus’ departure until that moment:
and, therefore, what Byrrhia says about following
him thither must be nonsense. This passage is
made very clear by Madame Dacier, who shews
that <span lang="la">Id propterea</span> is the commencement of another
sentence, and makes <em>hunc</em> refer to Simo, instead of
Pamphilus. The lines ought to be read thus,</p>

dread to hear his answer.</i></p>

<p>Some commentators make this speech come
from Davus; but it certainly is more natural from
Byrrhia: because, by the word <em>dread</em>, he expresses
a suspense about what the answer might be, which
Davus could not feel, because he and his master
had previously agreed upon it.</p>


<p class="p2 center">

<i>Byrrhia. (aside.) Ha! I am struck dumb; what did

</p>

<p class="center small" lang="la">

<p>I think this reading seems more consistent than
that which is usually printed, where obmutuit
comes from Davus: as <i>Byrrhia</i> might well be supposed
to <em>express surprise</em> at Pamphilus’s answer,
which was <em>directly different from what Pamphilus
and Charinus had previously agreed on</em>.</p>

<p>The dialogue of this scene is carried on too unconnectedly,
as Mr. Colman observes.</p>

<p>“Donatus remarks on this scene between
Byrrhia, Simo, Pamphilus, and Davus, that the
dialogue is sustained by four persons, who have
little or no intercourse with each other: so
that the scene is not only in direct contradiction
to the precept of Horace excluding a
fourth person, but is also otherwise vicious in its
construction. Scenes of this kind are, I think,
much too frequent in Terence, though, indeed, the
form of the ancient theatre was more adapted to the
representation of them than the modern. The multiplicity
of speeches <em>aside</em> is also the chief error in
his dialogue; such speeches, though very common
in dramatic writers, ancient and modern, being
always more or less unnatural. Myrtle’s suspicions,
grounded on the intelligence drawn from Bevil’s
servant, are more artfully imagined by the English
poet, than those of Charinus, created by employing
his servant as a spy on the actions of Pamphilus.”—<span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>

<p>There is a jest in the Latin, which it is impossible
to preserve in a translation: it turns on the word
<em>malum</em>, which was used at Rome to signify the
punishment inflicted on a slave, who played his
part badly on the stage: as the inferior characters
in a Roman play were personated by slaves. Thus,
Byrrhia means to say, I shall rehearse my part so
little to my master’s satisfaction, that I am sure to
be punished. The writings of Terence abound with
allusions of different kinds. It is not improbable
that Terence acquired a taste for dramatic writing,
by frequenting the stage in his youth, before he
obtained his liberty: as slaves were employed in
the theatres in considerable numbers. It is remarkable
that several very eminent Latin and Greek
writers were originally slaves; Terence, Cæcilius,
Æsop, Diocles, Rhianus, Epictetus, Tyrannion, and
(<em>as some say</em>) Plautus, were all elevated from a servile
station. A celebrated writer remarks on this
subject as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“Of the politest and best writers of antiquity,
several were slaves, or the immediate descendants
of slaves. But all the difficulties occasioned by
their low birth, mean fortune, want of friends, and
defective education, were surmounted by their <em>love
of letters</em>, and that generous spirit, which incites,</p>

<p>This is the last passage in this play that has been
altered by the learned French writer, whom I have

as follows,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Dum licitum est illi, dumque ætas tulit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Si vixit liberius, at cavit ne id sibi</div>

<p>I have now completed my extracts of the alterations
made by this very learned and judicious
writer, of various passages in our author, which
might sound somewhat harsh to a delicate ear.
I cannot but think that these alterations are worthy
of the attention of the editors of Latin classics, who
might adopt them with advantage in those editions
of Terence, which are intended to be introduced
into schools. It is impossible to be too cautious respecting
those writings which are placed in the
hands of youth: that work, perhaps, has the greatest
merit, which can be submitted to their perusal
most unreservedly.</p>

<p class="center small">
“Virtutem doctrina paret.”—<span class="smcap">Horace.</span><br>
</p>

<p>I shall conclude this subject with an extract from
that inestimable Tractate of Education, addressed
by Milton to Mr. Samuel Hartlib: after various instructions
to those who superintend the studies of
youth, he observes, “Either now, or before this,
they may have easily learnt, at any odd hour, the
<em>Italian</em> tongue; and soon after, but with <em>wariness
and good antidote</em>, it would be wholesome enough
to let them taste some choice comedies, <em>Greek</em>,
<em>Latin</em>, or <em>Italian</em>. Those tragedies, also, that
treat of household matters, as <cite>Trachiniæ</cite>, <cite>Alcestis</cite>,
and the like.”</p>

<i>He was cautious as a gentleman should be.</i><br>
<br>
Cavit——ut <em>virum fortem</em> decet.<br>
</p>

<p>The words virum fortem in this passage do not
mean a brave man, but a noble, well-bred, or honourable
man. Latin authors sometimes used fortis
in that sense. Thus, Ovid, speaking of Polyxena,
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="la">
   <div class="verse indent0a">“Rapta sinu matris, quam jam propè sola fovebat,</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">Fortis, et infelix, et plusquam fœmina, virgo</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">Ducitur ad tumulum; diroque fit hostia busto.”</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent0">The noble maid, her mother’s only hope,</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">Torn from her fostering arms by barbarous force,</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">Was led a victim to Achilles’ tomb:</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">Where, to appease the hero’s angry shade,</div>
   <div class="verse indent0">They offered up the life of her he loved.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Romans used virtus also in a similar manner
to signify virtue, bravery, and nobleness. The
Greek word <span lang="el">καλὸς</span> was of the same signification with
the Latin fortis: it meant sometimes a brave, sometimes
a virtuous man. Menander employs <span lang="el">τα καλα</span>
in this sense,</p>

<i>Simo. Yet he appeared to me to be somewhat melancholy.</i><br>
</p>

<p>This is admirably contrived by our author. Pamphilus
is a youth of so open and ingenuous a disposition,
that he cannot attempt to practise the
slightest deceit upon his father, without a visible
uneasiness and sadness in his demeanour. Terence
conducts this affair in a manner infinitely more
natural than does Sir R. Steele; who makes young
Bevil counterfeit an eagerness to attend the lady
his father designs for him, that is rather inconsistent
with strict ingenuousness. But Terence has
shewn wonderful art in his portraiture of Pamphilus’s
behaviour in this scene: he asks his father
no questions; he is silent and spiritless; and sedulously
avoids mentioning any thing connected with
his marriage, or his intended bride, and, as Mr.
Colman ingeniously suggests, Pamphilus’s dissimulation
may find some palliations in the artful
instigations of Davus.</p>

<i>Ten drachms for the wedding supper.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Instead of referring the reader to the Table of
Money in <a href="#note_208">Note 208</a>, for the value of the drachma,
I purpose to enter more at large, in this place, into
a subject that has so much occupied the attention of
the learned. The drachma, (<span lang="el">δραχμὴ</span>,) it is generally
agreed, was equal to three scruples, six
oboli, (<span lang="el">ὀβολὸς</span>,) and eighteen siliqua, (<span lang="el">κέρατιον</span>).
Pliny, Valerius Maximus, and Strabo, believed the
Attic drachma and the Roman denarius to be equivalent.
But, if we admit of the correctness of this
estimation, it affords us no certain information, as
authors can agree as little on the value of the denarius,
as on that of the drachma. Kennett computes
the Roman denarius at 7<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 2<abbr title="farthings"><i>qrs.</i></abbr>; Greaves, Arbuthnot,
and Adams, at 7<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 3<abbr title="farthings"><i>q.</i></abbr>; Tillemont at
11<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>, and, in the Philosophical Transactions, (<abbr title="Volume 61">Vol.
LXI.</abbr>, Part <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 48.) they estimate the denarius
at 8<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 1½<abbr title="farthings"><i>q.</i></abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Raper makes the Attic drachm worth
9<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> <sup>286</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub>. Greaves reckons it equal to 67 grains,
which, supposing silver to be sold at 5<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> per ounce,
fixes the drachm at 8<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 1½<i>qr.</i> Dr. Arbuthnot
computes it 6<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 3<abbr title="farthings"><i>qr.</i></abbr> <sup>1368</sup>&frasl;<sub>4704</sub>. Others fix the Attic talent
at 187<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 10<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr>, and the drachm at 7<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 2<abbr title="farthings"><i>qrs.</i></abbr>, or the
eighth part of an ounce of silver. If we take the
mean of these computations, we may suppose the
Attic drachm to have been equal to 8<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>; the
Eginean to 13<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> 3 <i>qrs.</i>; the insular to 16<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>; and
the drachm of Antioch, to 48<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> The learned Madame
Dacier speaks of the Attic drachm thus:
<span lang="fr">“la drachme Attique valait à peu près <em>cinq sols</em>.”</span>
No person, I think I may venture to assert, was
ever more habitually correct than Madame D.</p>

<i>Indeed, Sir, I think you are too frugal; it is not
well timed.</i><br>
<br>
Tu <i>quoque</i> perparce nimium. Non laudo.<br>
</p>

<p>Donatus thinks, that the force of <em>quoque</em> in this
line is as follows: <em>He (Pamphilus) is much to blame
for his childish petulance in taking offence at so trifling
a circumstance: and you (Simo)</em> <span class="allsmcap">ALSO</span> <em>are to
blame for having made so sparing a provision for
your son’s wedding supper</em>. Terence has managed
the whole circumstance very artfully: Simo intending
to deceive Pamphilus and Davus, had provided
to the amount of ten drachms, which was sixty
times more than the expense of Chremes’ supper,
which cost but an obolus, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_120">Note 120</a>,) and accounts
for what he said to Sosia, Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_60">Note 60</a>.) But we are meant to suppose, that
his frugality would not allow him to support the
deceit by purchasing a plentiful wedding supper,
which, among the Athenian citizens of rank, was a
most expensive entertainment. (<i>Vide</i> <abbr title="Herodotus Book One Chapter">Herodot. B. 1.

<i>Davus. (aside.) I’ve ruffled him now.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Simo is supposed to overhear this speech of
Davus. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#note_210">Note 210</a>.</p>

<p>The whole of the second act (as well as the first)
has been preserved in Baron’s Andrienne, without
alteration.</p>

<p>In the Conscious Lovers, the second act varies
considerably. Instead of the scene between Davus
and his master, Indiana and Isabella are introduced,
and afterwards Indiana and Bevil: but
both these scenes are entirely barren of incident.
Bevil protects Indiana, as Pamphilus protects Glycera;
but the former is on the footing of a <em>protector
only</em>, and remains an undeclared lover until the
fifth act.</p>

<p>Terence has wrought up the second act of this
play with the utmost art and caution: a particular
beauty in the pieces written by this great poet appears
in the judicious disposition of his incidents,
and in his so industriously concealing his catastrophe
until the proper time for its appearance.
This is a circumstance of great importance in dramatic
writing, to which some authors pay too little
attention. An ingenious critic of the last age has
pointed out a very extraordinary instance of a total
deficiency of art in this respect, where both the
<em>plot</em> and the <em>catastrophe</em> are completely <em>revealed in
the very title</em>. This piece is <cite>Venice Preserved, or
the Plot Discovered</cite>, which is, in other respects, a
very fine production. How much such a title as
this must deaden the interest that an audience
would otherwise feel from their suspense! This is a
point which admits of no argument.</p>

<p>The circumstance of a female officiating as a medical
attendant is of some importance. Caius
Hyginus, a learned Spaniard, and the freedman of
Augustus Cæsar, mentions in his “<cite>Mythological
Fables</cite>” an ancient Athenian law, prohibiting women
from the practice of physic: this prohibition
was productive of great inconvenience in <em>many
cases</em>, and afterwards repealed; when <em>free women</em>
were suffered to practise midwifery. To ascertain
the date of this repeal, would afford us some guide
to fix on <em>the times</em>, when the scenes described in this
play were supposed to happen, and the <em>manners</em> of
which both Menander and Terence meant to portray.</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of following the example

<p class="hanging"><i>Simo.—O Jupiter! what do I hear? it is all over
if what she says be truth!—is he so mad? a foreigner
too!</i></p>

<p>I imagine that in this passage, Terence meant
Simo to call Glycera a <em>foreigner</em> merely, and not a
woman of light character, which <dfn>peregrina</dfn> sometimes
means, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_82">Note 82</a>.) Madame Dacier
translates the words ex peregrina by <span lang="fr">“<em>quoi d’une
étrangère? c’est à dire d’une courtisane, car comme
je l’ai remarqué ailleurs, on donnoit le nom d’étrangères
à toutes les femmes debauchées</em>: et je crois qu’ils
avoient pris cela des Orientaux; car on trouve
étrangère en ce sens là dans les livres du <span class="smcap">Vieux
Testament</span>.”</span> But peregrina will hardly bear this
interpretation in this particular passage, because
we must suppose that Simo had not that opinion of
Glycera’s character; for he himself (Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>)
says, that her appearance was “so modest and so
charming, that nothing could surpass it.” Simo,
however, had sufficient reason for exclamation;
supposing that he considered Glycera merely as a
person who was not a native of Athens. The Athenian
laws were rigorously strict in prohibiting a
citizen from contracting a marriage with any woman
who was not a citizen: if such a marriage was
contracted, and the parties impeached and convicted,
the husband was fined very heavily, in proportion
to his property; the wife sold for a slave;
and any person who was proved to have used any
species of deceit to induce the Athenian to form
this forbidden connexion, was punished with the
worst kind of infamy, which included the loss of
his liberty and of his estate. The first of these
punishments was called <span lang="el">ζημία</span>, the second <span lang="el">δουλεία</span>,
and the third <span lang="el">ἀτιμία</span>. If Simo, therefore, supposed
that Glycera was not a citizen, and believed Pamphilus
to be her husband, his apprehensions appear
very natural.</p>

<i>Glycera.—O Juno, Lucina, help! save me, I beseech
thee.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Though Juno was sometimes called Lucina, Diana
is the goddess here called Juno Lucina. Diana
received the appellation of Juno, (as I apprehend,)
because she was considered by the ancients as
presiding over women in child-birth: and might,
therefore, very properly be termed <dfn>Juno</dfn>, the
guardian <dfn>genius</dfn> of women; as Junones was the
usual name for those spirits who were supposed to
be the protectors of women, as the genii were
thought to be the guardians of men: (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_106">Note 106.</a>)
<em>Catullus</em> addressing Diana, calls her expressly by
the names Juno Lucina:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Tu <em>Lucina</em> dolentibus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Juno</em> dicta puerperis.”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, Juno Lucina called</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By women who implore thy aid.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Cicero</em> also confirms the assertion of Catullus,
<span lang="la">“Ut apud Græcos Dianam eamque Luciferam, sic
apud nostros <em>Junonem Lucinam</em> invocant.”</span> As the
Greeks call upon Diana Lucifera, so we call upon
the same goddess by the names of Juno Lucina.
Diana was almost universally worshipped in Greece,
where many magnificent temples were erected in
her honour: amongst which, was that of Ephesus,
reckoned one of the wonders of the world. Of this
magnificent structure, the ruins may now be seen
near Ajasalouc in Natolia. The temple was purposely
burned by Eratorastus, who adopted this
mode of perpetuating his name. The Greek festivals
celebrated in honour of their imaginary deities
were almost innumerable: and those dedicated to
Diana, shew the high estimation in which she was
held. A surprising number of festivals were celebrated
in honour of this goddess, in various parts
of Greece. The following are the names of the
chief of those held in Athens,</p>

<p>Another allusion to the drama: Simo compares
Davus’s supposed plot to a comedy, and Davus the
contriver of it he calls <dfn>magister</dfn>, which was the title
of the person who instructed the actors in their
parts, or perhaps the title of the author. Simo accuses
Davus of bringing forward his catastrophe
too soon, and asks him whether the actors in his
piece (<dfn>discipuli</dfn>) had forgotten their parts.</p>

<p>Ancient dramatic writers were very strict in adhering
to their rules of composition.</p>

<p>According to Vossius, the ancients divided a
comedy into three parts: 1. <dfn>protasis</dfn>, 2. <dfn>epitasis</dfn>,
3. <dfn>catastrophe</dfn>. The <dfn>protasis</dfn> occupied Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and
was devoted to the explanation of the argument.
The <dfn>epitasis</dfn> took up Act <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, contained
the incidents, and wrought up the mind to a degree
of interest, taking care to leave it <em>in doubt</em>;
which brought on the catastrophe, which unravelled
and cleared up the whole; and is defined by <i>Scaliger</i>
thus, “<cite lang="la">conversio negotii exagitati in tranquillitatem
non expectatam</cite>:” <cite>a sudden changing of the
hurry and bustle of action into unexpected tranquillity</cite>.
The same learned critic adds a fourth part to
the before-mentioned three, which he calls <dfn>catastasis</dfn>,
and places immediately before the catastrophe:
he defines the catastasis as follows, “<cite lang="la">vigor
ac status fabulæ, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunæ
tempestate, in quam subducta est</cite>:” <cite>that liveliness
and issue of the plot, in which the various incidents
are mixed up in such a commotion of fortune as to be
in a proper state to be brought down to the catastrophe</cite>.</p>

<p>This is an allusion to the games which were exhibited
among the ancients with a view to entertain
the people; and also to create in them a spirit of
emulation in glorious actions. Games, both in
Greece and Rome, constituted a part of religious
worship; they were divided into three classes,
1. what the Romans called <dfn>ludi equestres</dfn>, or horse,
and chariot-races; 2. <dfn>ludi agonales</dfn>, or combats of
gladiators and others, and also of beasts; 3. <dfn>ludi
scenici et musici</dfn>, or dramatic exhibitions of all kinds,
music, dancing, <i>&amp;c.</i> The chief games among the
Greeks were, 1. the <i>Olympic</i>, dedicated to Jupiter;
2. the <i>Pythian</i>, to Apollo; 3. the <i>Nemæan</i>, to Hercules;
4. the <i>Isthmian</i>, to Neptune; 5. the games
celebrated at the observation of the <i>Eleusinian</i> mysteries,
in honour of Ceres and Proserpine: 6. <i>the
great Panathenæa</i>, dedicated to Minerva. Those
who obtained the victory in these games, were universally
distinguished; and their success reflected
glory on their family, and even on the cities from
whence they came; part of the wall of which was
thrown down to admit them in triumph on their return.
Those Athenians who were conquerors in
the Olympic games, were afterwards (<em>at their own
option</em>,) maintained at the public charge, and enjoyed
various extraordinary privileges. Among the
Romans, the principal games were, 1. <dfn>the Ludi
Romani</dfn>, dedicated to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva;
2. <dfn>the Sæculares</dfn>, to the deities and the fates; 3.
<dfn>the Consuales</dfn>, to Neptunus Equestris; 4. <dfn>the Capitolini</dfn>,
to Jupiter Capitolinus. The Romans celebrated
their games chiefly in the Circus Maximus;
which, as a place of entertainment, was magnificently
extensive. Pliny asserts that it would contain
<em>one quarter of a million</em> of spectators; and more
modern authors have augmented that number to
380,000.</p>

<p>Though I have followed the common reading in
this passage, as it is not a point of any importance,
I think it doubtful whether Terence meant Lesbia to
speak of the mother or the child, when she said
the words <cite lang="la">fac ut lavet</cite>, as the Greeks practised a
remarkable ceremony on new-born infants, in order
to strengthen them. A mixture of water, oil, and
wine, was made in a vessel kept for the purpose,
which they called <span lang="el">λουτρὸν</span> and <span lang="el">χύτλος</span>, and, with this
liquid, they <em>washed</em> the children; as some think,
they wished to try the strength of the infant’s constitution,
which, if weak, yielded to the powerful
fumes of the wine, and the children fell into fits.
I imagine that this was done, when it was the question
if an infant should be exposed, as puny, sickly
children sometimes were. (<i>Vide</i> <a href="#note_93">Note 93</a>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Now, finding that the marriage preparations are
going forwards in our house, she sends her maid to
fetch a midwife.</i></p>

<p>This is a very subtle contrivance. Davus intends
that the birth of Pamphilus’s child shall be reported
to Chremes to alarm him, (as we see Act <abbr title="Five">V</abbr>.
Scene <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> page 82,) and, therefore, that Simo may
not suspect <em>him</em>, he persuades him that Glycera is
contriving to spread reports of Pamphilus’s engagements
to her. M. Baron has entirely omitted the
incident of the birth of the child. He introduces
Sosia again to fill up the chasm. In a scene between
Simo, Davus, and Chremes, the latter is
induced to renew his consent to the marriage, by
overhearing a conversation between Simo and Davus;
in which, as in the original, the slave invents
a tale that Pamphilus and Glycera are at variance.</p>

<p>Sir R. Steele varies the third act altogether; he
makes it turn wholly on the underplot, of which the
chief personages are Lucinda, and her two lovers
Myrtle and Cimberton: the latter is a pedantic coxcomb,
and added to the original characters by
the English poet.</p>

<p>Terence uses an expression in the beginning of
this scene that has been a source of discussion
among the critics. It is in the following line,</p>

<p class="center small" lang="la">
“Atque haud scio <span class="allsmcap">AN</span> quæ dixit sint vera omnia.”<br>
</p>

<p>I have selected from a very long note on this
passage, by an eminent writer, the following extracts,
which will afford, I trust, a satisfactory
elucidation of the line in question.</p>

<p>“<cite>Atque haud scio an quæ dixit sint vera omnia</cite>:
this seems, at first sight, to signify, <dfn>I do not know
if all that he has told me be truth</dfn>; but, in the elegance
of the Latin expression, however, <cite>haud scio
an</cite>, means the same as <dfn>fortasse</dfn> (perhaps) as if he
had said <cite>haud scio an non</cite>. Thus, in the Brothers,
<abbr title="Act Four Scene Five verse">A. IV. S. V. v.</abbr> 33. <cite lang="la">Qui infelix haud scio an illam
misere non amat</cite>: which does not mean, <cite>I do not
know whether he loves her</cite>, but, on the contrary, <cite>I do
not know that he does not love her</cite>. Also, in Cicero’s
Epistles, <abbr title="book nine line">B. IX. L.</abbr> 13., <cite lang="la">Istud quidem magnum,
atque haud scio an maximum</cite>; <cite>this is a great thing,
and perhaps the greatest of all, or, I do not know
but it is the greatest of all</cite>. And, also, in his Oration
for Marcellus, when he said that future ages
would form a juster estimate of Cæsar’s character
than could be made by men of his own times; he
says, <cite lang="la">Servis iis etiam indicibus qui multis post sæculis
de te judicabunt, et quidem haud scio, an incorruptius
quam nos</cite>. There are numberless examples
of this kind in the writings of Cicero, and I know
that there are some which make for the opposite
side of the question, as in his book on “<cite>Old Age</cite>,”
speaking of a country life, he says, <cite lang="la">Atque haud
scia an ulla possit esse beatior vita</cite>. But, it is my
opinion, that these passages have been altered by
some person who did not understand that mode of
expression, and that it ought to be, <span lang="la">Atque haud
scio an <em>nulla</em> possit esse beatior vita.”</span> <span class="smcap">The Author</span>

<abbr title="Act Three Scene Four">A. III. S. IV.</abbr> <i>Simo, Chremes.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Simo.—Chremes, I am very glad to see you.</i><br>
</p>

<p><span lang="la">“Jubeo Chremetem (<em>saluere</em>)”</span>: the last word is
not spoken, because the speaker is interrupted by
Simo. It is necessary to observe that <dfn>jubeo</dfn> does
not always signify to <dfn>command</dfn>, but sometimes
means to <dfn>wish</dfn>, to <dfn>desire</dfn>, especially when the
speaker’s wish is afterwards verbally expressed;
according to what Donatus observes on this passage,
<span lang="la">“Columus animo, jubemus verbis.”</span>—<span class="smcap">Old

<p>Terence has portrayed Chremes as a very amiable
character; he is mild and patient, and the most
benevolent sentiments issue from his lips. It was
necessary, as Donatus observes, to represent
Chremes with this temper, for, had he been violent
and headstrong, he could not have been supposed
to seek Simo, and afterwards <em>renew his consent</em>,
which is a very important incident, upon which the
remainder of the epitasis entirely hinges. The
Chremes of Sir R. Steele (<cite>Sealand</cite>) has all the
worth of Terence’s original, but is deficient in that
polish of manners which renders the Latin character
so graceful.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Simo.—Yet the most serious mischief, after all, can
amount but to a separation, which may the gods
avert.</i></p>

<p>The Athenian laws permitted citizens to divorce
their wives on very trivial pretences; but compelled
them, at the same time, to give in a memorial
to the <i lang="la">archons</i>, stating the grounds on which the
divorce was desired. A citizen might put away his
wife, without any particular disgrace being attached
to either the husband or the wife; and
when the divorce was by mutual consent, the parties
were at liberty to contract elsewhere. He who
divorced his wife, was compelled to restore her
dowry, though he was allowed to pay it by instalments:
sometimes it was paid as alimony, nine
oboli each month.</p>

<p>For a very flagrant offence, a wife, by the Athenian
laws, might divorce her husband: if the men
divorced, they were said <span lang="el">ἀποπέμπειν</span>, or <span lang="el">ἀπολεύειν</span>,
to send away their wives: but if the women divorced,
they were said <span lang="el">ἀπολείπειν</span>, to quit their
husbands. (<i>Vide Potter’s Arch. Græc.</i>, <abbr title="Volume Two, Book 4, Chapter">Vol. II.
B. IV. C.</abbr> 12.)</p>

<p>Terence artfully makes Simo use the word <i lang="la">discessio</i>
instead of <i lang="la">divortium</i>, or <i lang="la">discidium</i>, or <i lang="la">repudium</i>:
which means the worst kind of divorce.
<i lang="la">Discessio</i>, among the Romans, was nearly the same
as <dfn>a separation</dfn> among us: by separation, I mean
what our lawyers call <i lang="la">divorce a mensa et thoro</i>;
<em>which does not dissolve the marriage</em>; and which
they place in opposition to <i lang="la">divorce a vinculo matrimonii</i>;
which is a total divorce. In the earlier
ages of the Roman Republic, the wife had no option
of divorcing her husband: but it was afterwards
allowed, as we see in <cite>Martial</cite>.</p>

<i>Pam.—What trust can I put in such a rascal?</i><br>
<br>
<span lang="la">Oh! tibi ego ut credam <span class="allsmcap">FURCIFER</span></span>?</p>

<p>The epithet <dfn>furcifer</dfn> (rascal) is of singular derivation;
and, though it was an appellation of great
reproach in the times of Terence, yet, in later ages
of the Roman Republic, it bore a very different
signification. The name of <dfn>furcifer</dfn>, which was
originally given to slaves, took its rise from the
Roman custom of punishing a slave who had committed
any flagrant offence, by fastening round his
neck a heavy piece of wood, in the shape of a fork,
and thence called furca; this occasioned the delinquent
to be afterwards called furcifer, (<span lang="la">furcam
ferre</span>.) Three modes of punishment by the furca
were practised at Rome: 1. ignominious, 2. penal,
3. capital. In the first, the criminal merely carried
the furca on his shoulders for a short period;
in the second, he wore the furca, and was whipped
round the Forum; in the third, after having been
tied to a large furca, somewhat like a modern gallows,
he was beaten to death. Slaves were treated
more severely by the Romans than by the Athenians,
who were celebrated for their mild and gentle behaviour
to that class of persons. The furca was
afterwards employed in a very different manner;
and, from a badge of disgrace, was changed to a
serviceable implement. Caius Marius, nearly a
hundred years after Terence composed this play,
introduced the use of the furca among his soldiers.
It was employed to carry baggage and other requisites;
and, in use, somewhat resembled a modern
porter’s knot, hence, the word <dfn>furculum</dfn> or <dfn>ferculum</dfn>,
became an expression to signify a burden, or
any thing carried in the hand: and sometimes,
also, the various courses brought to table, as in
<cite>Horace</cite>,</p>

<p>Terence, in the composition of these lines, has
admirably succeeded in expressing the sense by the
sounds and measure of his verse, and the very lines
seem as angry (if I may be allowed to use such an
expression) as Charinus, who is to speak them, is
supposed to be. The whole speech is written with
a great deal of fire and spirit; and represents, in a
very lively manner, the impatient bursts of indignation,
and the broken periods which issue from the
mouth of an enraged and disappointed person,
during the first transports of his anger. The ancients
particularly studied this poetical beauty;
and many of them have reached a degree of excellence
scarcely inferior to that of the moderns.
Terence has as eminently distinguished himself by
his success in this ornament to composition as he
has by his other excellencies: as familiar verse,
his compositions are extremely harmonious.</p>

<p>Mr. Pope has described the poetical embellishment
before mentioned in a most inimitable poem,
which at once explains and exemplifies his meaning.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“’Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sound must seem an echo to the sense:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Ajax strives some rock’s vast weight to throw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The line too labours, and the words move slow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flies o’er th’ unbending corn, and skims along the main.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Virgil was particularly successful in his endeavours
to impart this ornament to his composition.

a beautiful specimen of his ability in this species of
verse.</p>

<p>This is one of those beautiful passages which
prove Terence to have been so able a delineator of
character. How faithful a picture does he here
draw of this particular species of weakness! A
man is asked a favour which he knows it is out of
his power to compass, and yet feels a repugnance
to candidly avow it: he cannot bear to witness the
uneasiness of the disappointed person, and, from a
kind of false shame, he misleads him with a promise
which he cannot perform. To detect those
lurking impulses which almost escape observation,
though they influence the actions: to describe with
force and elegance, and convince the mind of a
feeling of which it was before scarcely conscious, is
an effort of genius worthy of a Terence.</p>

<p>The soliloquy of Charinus, (of which the lines
I have cited in the commencement of this Note form
a part,) is one of the best written in the plays of
our author: it is exactly of the kind recommended
by the <i>Duke of Buckingham</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Soliloquies had need be very few,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">They trust a friend only to tell it us.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A soliloquy is introduced with most success, when
the speaker of it is supposed to be deliberating
with himself on doubtful subjects: but, when narration
is to be introduced, it is brought forward
with more advantage in the shape of a dialogue
between the speaker and his confidant. But a
skilful dramatist can often employ a preferable method
to either of those I have just named, for the
disposition of narration. Papias lays it down as an
absolute rule for the composition of soliloquies,
that they must be deliberations only.</p>

<i>Well, take her.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Sir R. Steele, in his play, called <cite>the Conscious
Lovers</cite>, does not represent Myrtle as comporting
himself in his disappointment with the moderation
observed by Charinus. He challenges Bevil:
though the duel is afterwards prevented by the
patience and forbearance of the latter, who communicates
to his angry friend a letter which he had
received from Lucinda, expressive of her favourable
thoughts of Myrtle. The ingenious author of
the Conscious Lovers imagined, no doubt, that to
an English audience, Charinus’s easy resignation of
his mistress to Pamphilus would appear tame and
unnatural. In nothing do the manners of the
ancients and the moderns differ more widely than
in their respective behaviour in cases of private
injury, real or imagined. Among the ancient
Greeks and Romans, <em>duelling</em> was totally unknown.
Alexander and Pyrrhus, Themistocles, Leonidas,
and Epaminondas, the Scipios and Hannibal,
Cæsar and Pompey, all men whose fame will never
be surpassed, and a countless number of the heroes
of antiquity, would have scorned to draw their
swords in a private quarrel. It was reserved for
Christians, to introduce and countenance this barbarous
practice; which ought to be the shame of
civilized humanity. Barbarous, however, it can
scarcely with justice be called: for those nations
whose unpolished manners caused them to be
termed barbarians, were never known to have
adopted it; nor has a single instance occurred,
where men, in a state of uncultivated nature, have
been known to sacrifice a brother’s life in the mortal
arbitration of a private quarrel. Duelling was
originally practised among northern nations. Those
who wish to entertain just ideas on this subject
cannot do better than to consult <cite>A Discourse on
Duelling, by the Rev. Thomas Jones, A.M., Trinity
College, Cambridge</cite>.</p>

<p>Literally, a noise is made on the inside of Glycera’s
door. As all the street-doors in Athens
opened towards the street, it was customary to
knock loudly on the inside, before the door was
thrown open, lest, by a sudden and violent swing,
the heavy barrier should injure any of the passengers.
The Greeks called this ceremony <span lang="el">ψοφεῖν
θυραν</span>. All the doors of the Romans opened inwards,
unless (which rarely happened) a law was
passed to allow any particular person to open his
door towards the street. This was considered a
very great honour, and never conferred but as a
reward for very eminent services.</p>

<p>In Sparta, a law prevailed that no instrument but
a kind of saw should be employed in making the
doors of the houses; this regulation was intended
to prevent luxury, and wasteful expense. Both in
Athens and Rome, the first room within the door
was made extremely large, and highly ornamented.
This room was called aula by the Romans, and, by
the Greeks <span lang="el">αὐλὴ</span>. Here were placed the trophies
gained by the master of the house, and by his family.
In later and more luxurious ages, the doors
were made of more costly materials, sometimes

<p class="hanging"><i>Mysis. (speaking to Glycera within.) I will directly,
Madam; wherever he may be, I’ll take care to
find your dear Pamphilus, and bring him to you:
only, my love, let me beg you not to make yourself
so wretched.</i></p>

<p>Sir R. Steele and Monsieur Baron have brought
both Glycera and Philumena on the stage; but, in
the Latin drama, the principal female characters
(if they appear at all) are generally mutes. It is a
circumstance worthy of our attention, that (except
in one instance) Terence never brings on the stage
any female character of rank and consideration:
the women who take a part in the dialogue are generally
either attendants, or professional people, as
nurses, midwives, <i>&amp;c.</i> But this exclusion, (though
our author has been compelled to sacrifice to it all
those embellishments which the portraiture of the
Athenian ladies must have added to his scenes,)
is in strict conformity with the manners of the
Greeks. Grecian women of rank seldom appeared
in company, and closely confined themselves
within doors, occupying the most remote parts of
the house. Unmarried women were scarcely allowed
to quit the rooms they inhabited, without
giving previous notice to their protectors. Terence
was instructed clearly in this point, by his great original
<cite>Menander</cite>; who expressly says, that the door
of the <span lang="el">αὐλὴ</span>, or hall, was a place where even a married
woman ought never to be seen. Women,
among the Greeks, seldom inhabited the same
apartment with the men: their rooms were always
kept as retired as possible, usually in the loftiest
part of the house. <i>Vide</i> Hom. <abbr title="Iliad">Il.</abbr>, γʹ <abbr title="verse">v.</abbr> 423; their
apartments were called Gynæceum, (<span lang="el">γυναικεῖον</span>).
<i>Vide</i> Terence’s Phormio, Act 5. <abbr title="Scene">S.</abbr> 6, where he
says,</p>

<p class="center" lang="la">
“Ubi in <em>Gynæceum</em> ire occipio, puer ad me accurrit Mida.”<br>
</p>

<p>These rooms were sometimes called <span lang="el">ὦα</span>, which
signifies also <dfn>eggs</dfn>; it is supposed that the fable of
Castor, Pollux, Helen, and Clytemnestra, being
hatched from eggs, took its rise from the double
signification of the word <span lang="el">ὦα</span>.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, no oracles were either so
numerous or so highly esteemed as those of
Apollo. The first place among them is assigned to
the oracle at Delphi, near mount Parnassus, which
excelled the others in magnificence, and claimed
the precedence in point of antiquity. Next to this,
ranks the oracle in the island of Delos, the birthplace
of Apollo and Diana. It is situated in the
north part of Mare Ægeum, or Archipelago, not
far from the Isle of Andros, and between Myconus
and Rhene. The Athenians reverenced this oracle
above all others, and its answers were held to be
infallible. Theseus, the most celebrated of the
Athenian heroes, instituted a solemn procession to
Delos, in honour of Apollo. A certain number of
Athenian citizens were chosen, who were called
<span lang="el">Θεωροὶ</span>, who made the voyage in a sacred ship; the
same in which Theseus and his companions were
said to have sailed to Crete. This ship was denominated
<span lang="el">ἀειζώοντα</span>, on account of its great age: it
was preserved till the time of Demetrius Phalereus.
No criminal was ever put to death during the absence
of the sacred ship.</p>

<p>I have adopted the interpretation which M. le

expecting a compliment on his behaviour.
After a jest on his friend’s having reduced himself

of Davus, Charinus, by the word fortis, pays him
the compliment his handsome conduct deserved.</p>

<p>The Davus of M. Baron, instead of laying the

that Pamphilus intends to desert Glycera, and to
espouse Philumena: Mysis communicates this to
her mistress, who, in her distress, throws herself
at Chremes’ feet, and shews him the contract of her
marriage with Pamphilus. This induces Chremes
to favour Glycera, and to break off the intended
marriage.</p>

<i>Davus.—You may take some of the herbs from that
altar, and strew them under him.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“Altar, Altare, Ara, a place or pile whereon to
offer sacrifice to some deity. Among the Romans,
the <dfn>altar</dfn> was a kind of pedestal, either square,
round, or triangular; adorned with sculpture, with
basso-relievos, and inscriptions, whereon were
burnt the victims sacrificed to idols. According to
Servius, those <dfn>altars</dfn> set apart for the honour of the
celestial gods, and gods of the higher class, were
placed on some pretty tall pile of building; and,
for that reason, were called <dfn>altaria</dfn>, from the word
<dfn>alta</dfn> and <dfn>ara</dfn>, a high elevated <dfn>altar</dfn>. Those appointed
for the terrestrial gods, were laid on the
surface of the earth, and called <dfn>aræ</dfn>. And, on the
contrary, they dug into the earth, and opened a
pit for those of the infernal gods which were called
<span lang="el">βοθροι λακκοι</span>, <i lang="la">scrobiculi</i>. But this distinction is not
every-where observed: the best authors frequently
use <i>ara</i> as a general word, under which are included
the altars of the celestial and infernal,
as well as those of the terrestrial gods. Witness
Virgil, <abbr title="Eclogues">Ecl.</abbr> 5.</p>

<p class="center">
——<i lang="la">En quatuor aras</i>,<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">where <i>aræ</i> plainly includes <i>altaria</i>; for whatever
we make of Daphnis, Phœbus was certainly a
celestial god. So Cicero, pro Quint. <cite lang="la">Aras delubraque
Hecates in Græcia vidimus.</cite> The Greeks,
also, distinguish two sorts of <dfn>altars</dfn>; that whereon
they sacrificed to the gods was called <span lang="el">βωμος</span>, and
was a real <dfn>altar</dfn>, different from the other, whereon
they sacrificed to the heroes, which was smaller,
and called <span lang="el">εσχαρα</span>. Pollux makes this distinction
of <dfn>altars</dfn> in his Onomasticon: he adds, however,
that some poets used the word <span lang="el">εσχαρα</span>, for the
altar whereon sacrifice was offered to the gods.
The Septuagint version does sometimes also use
the word <span lang="el">εσχαρα</span>, for a sort of little low <dfn>altar</dfn>,
which may be expressed in Latin by <i lang="la">craticula</i>,
being a hearth, rather than an <dfn>altar</dfn>.”—<span class="smcap">Chambers’</span>
<cite>Cyclopædia</cite>.</p>

<p>Scaliger thinks that the altar mentioned by Terence
was the altar usually placed on the stage of a
theatre during representation, and consecrated to
Bacchus in tragedy, and to Apollo in comedy. It
is most probable, that one of the <span lang="el">ἐσχάραι</span> is alluded
to by our author in this passage. The <span lang="el">ἐσχάραι</span>
were low altars which stood before the doors in
Athens: they were dedicated to the ancient heroes.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Davus.—That if my master should require me to
swear that I did not do it, I may take the oath
with a safe conscience.</i></p>

<p>The Greeks paid very great regard to oaths.
They divided them into two classes. The first kind
was the <span lang="el">μέγας ὅρκος</span>, or great oath, when the swearer
called the gods to witness his truth; the second
was the <span lang="el">μικρὸς ὅρκος</span>, when the swearer called on
other creatures. They usually, when falsely accused
of any crime, took an oath to clear themselves.
This oath was sometimes administered in a
very singular manner: the oath of exculpation was
written on a tablet, and hung round the neck, and
rested on the breast of the accused, who was then
compelled to wade into the sea about knee-deep:
if the oath was true, the water remained stationary;
but, if false, it instantly rose up, and covered the
tablet, that so dreadful a sight as a false oath
might be concealed from the view of mankind.
The Athenians were proverbial for their sincere
regard for truth. <i>Vide</i> Velleius Paterculus, <abbr title="Book">B.</abbr> 1.
<abbr title="Chapter">C.</abbr> 4., also, in <abbr title="Book">B.</abbr> 2. <abbr title="Chapter">C.</abbr> 23: we are told</p>

<p lang="la">“Adeò enim certa Atheniensum in Romanos
fides fuit, ut semper et in omni re, quicquid sincerâ
fide generetur, id Romani Atticâ fieri, prædicarent.”—<span class="smcap">Marcus
Velleius Paterculus</span>, <abbr title="Book">B.</abbr>
2. <abbr title="Chapter">C.</abbr> 23. <abbr title="Line">L.</abbr> 18.</p>

<p>The Athenians behaved with so much good faith
and inviolable honour in all their treaties with the
Romans, that it became a custom at Rome, when
a person was affirmed to be just and honourable, to
say, he is as faithful as an Athenian.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Davus. (to himself.) The father of the bride is

<p class="unindent"><i>Mysis.—I don’t understand this.</i></p>

<p>Davus’s first design was (we are to suppose) to
go to Simo as soon as Mysis had placed the child
at the door, and acquaint him that Glycera had
sent him Pamphilus’s child. This would have compelled
Simo to suspend the marriage until he had
ascertained the real nature of Glycera’s claims on
his son. Though Davus’s speech is not usually
read aside, we cannot suppose that Mysis heard
him say, that Chremes, the bride’s father, approached,
because, in the ninth scene of the same
act, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#FNanchor_184">p. 78, l. preantepen</a>,) he tells her, “that
was the bride’s father,” and she replies, “you
should have given me notice then.”</p>

such a question?</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Davus.—Whom should I ask? I can see no one else
here.</i></p>

<p>This certainly seems a little over-acted on the
part of Davus, considering that he knew Chremes
to be so very near him. If we conclude that Davus
acted his part with the proper gestures, and accompanied
the above words with the very natural
action of looking round him, to see if any other
person was visible near Simo’s door; it appears
extremely improbable that he should not have seen
Chremes, who was near enough to hear all that
passed between Davus and Mysis. Davus intended
that what passed between Mysis and himself should
be overheard by Chremes, whom he knew to be but
a very few yards distant. It seems extraordinary,
therefore, that Davus should make use of an expression
which compelled him to run the risk of
being obliged to recognise Chremes if he looked
round, and, if he did not, of raising a suspicion in
his mind, that Davus knew him to be there: either
circumstance must effectually have spoiled the
stratagem, to deter Chremes from the match. To
solve this apparent inconsistency, we must suppose
that Chremes, wishing, for obvious reasons, to
overhear what passed between Mysis and Davus,
had, at the entrance of the latter, withdrawn himself
behind a row of pillars, or into a portico, or
cloister, (which were common in the streets of
Athens, and were also built upon the Roman stage,)
lest his presence, which Mysis knew of, as he had
questioned her, should be a check upon their conversation;
from which he, of course, expected to
learn the truth respecting the child at Simo’s door,
as he knew that Mysis was the servant of Glycera,
and Davus the servant of Pamphilus.</p>

must terrify Chremes. He contradicts her, that
she may (in Chremes’ hearing) enter into the proof
of what she says. Instead of Cantharam, Nonnius
thinks that Terence meant cantharum, a large
jug; and that he intended Davus to say, that the
child was brought to Glycera’s house in a large
cantharus. <i>Vide</i> Nonnius’s <abbr title="Miscellanies, Book">Miscell., B.</abbr> 1, and

<p>The citizens of Athens were called <span lang="el">γηγενεῖς</span>, or

<span lang="el">τεττιγες</span>, or <span lang="el">τεττιγοφορους</span>, <dfn>wearers of grasshoppers</dfn>;
this appellation, authors have derived differently.
<cite>Tretzes</cite> thinks it was to designate them as fluent
orators. <cite>Lucian</cite> considers it merely as a distinction
to divide them from the slaves: and others
say, it was because they thought that grasshoppers
sprung from the earth; and therefore chose them
for the symbol of a people who pretended to the
same origin: <i>vide</i> <a href="#note_154a">Note 154</a>. The Athenians were
called also <span lang="el">πολίται</span>. The citizens were divided by
Cecrops into four tribes, (<i>vide</i> Poll., <abbr title="Book">B.</abbr> 3. 64,)
each tribe was divided into three classes, and each
class into thirty families. The names of the tribes
were, 1. <span lang="el">Κεκροπὶς</span>, 2. <span lang="el">Αὐτόχθων</span>, 3. <span lang="el">Ἀκταία</span>, 4.

by Cranaus, (<i>vide</i> <abbr title="Plutarch">Plut.</abbr> in Solon,) and also by
Ericthonius and Erectheus. When the number of
the inhabitants increased, new tribes were added.
To obtain the Athenian citizenship was deemed so
glorious, that foreigners of the very first rank eagerly
sought this distinction; which it was extremely
difficult to gain: as the Athenians would
never admit any persons but those who had signalized
themselves by their virtue and bravery.</p>

<p>The Athenian laws did not allow of polygamy:
if Glycera, therefore, had been proved to be a citizen,

valid; and Philumena, if married to him, must have
been divorced. We are to suppose, that the apprehension

many disputed readings in the plays of Terence,
which, by a reference to the various ancient <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>

An edition of the plays, regulated by the
authority of these <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>, would doubtless be
highly serviceable. The most learned woman of
her age, Madame Dacier, whose translation of Terence
is alone sufficient to perpetuate his name and
her own, in her preface to that inestimable work,
speaks at length, and in very high terms, of the
<abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> of Terence, in the library of his most Christian

“I found in them (the <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>) several things which
gave me the greatest pleasure, and which satisfactorily
prove the correctness of the most important
alterations which I have made in the text, as to the

hundred years old. <cite>Vide Madame Dacier’s Translation

himself, and the art which he has displayed in this
scene. The only scenes of a similar nature, (I mean
where the plot is carried on by a concerted conversation
intended to be overheard by some person who
thinks it genuine,) which are equal to this scene in
the Andrian, are the ninth scene of the second act,
and the first scene of the third act of Shakspeare’s
comedy of <cite>Much Ado about Nothing</cite>.</p>

<p>The before-mentioned scene from the Andrian
has been wholly omitted by Sir R. Steele. Sealand
does not renew his consent to the marriage till the
end of the fifth act.</p>

<p>M. Baron has introduced Crito earlier than he
appears in the Latin play, and closes the fourth
act with Glycera’s appeal to Chremes; and two
subsequent scenes between Glycera, Mysis, Pamphilus,
and Davus. Glycera’s appeal to Chremes
is extremely pathetic. It concludes with the following

<p class="hanging"><i>Davus.—Do you think that a thing of this sort can
be done as well by premeditating and studying, as
by acting according to the natural impulse of the
moment?</i></p>

<p>“It is an observation of Voltaire’s, in the Preface
to his comedy of L’Enfant Prodigue, that although
there are various kinds of pleasantry that
excite mirth, yet universal bursts of laughter are
seldom produced, unless by a scene of mistake or
<i lang="la">æquivoque</i>. A thousand instances might be given
to prove the truth of this judicious observation.
There is scarce any writer of comedy who has not
drawn from this source of humour. A scene,
founded on a misunderstanding between the parties,
where the characters are all at cross-purposes
with each other, never fails to set the audience in a
roar; nor, indeed, can there be a happier incident
in a comedy, if produced naturally, and managed
judiciously.</p>

<p>“The scenes in this act, occasioned by the artifice
of Davus concerning the child, do not fall directly
under the observation of Voltaire; but are, however,
so much of the same colour, that, if represented
on the stage, they would, I doubt not, have
the like effect, and be the best means of confuting
those infidel critics who maintain that Terence has
no humour. I do not remember a scene in any
comedy where there is such a natural complication
of pleasant circumstances. Davus’s sudden change
of his intentions on seeing Chremes, without having
time to explain himself to Mysis; her confusion and
comical distress, together with the genuine simplicity
of her answers; and the conclusion drawn by
Chremes from the supposed quarrel; are all finely
imagined, and directly calculated for the purposes
of exciting the highest mirth in the spectators.
The words of Davus to Mysis in this speech, “Is
there then,” <i>&amp;c.</i>, have the air of an oblique praise of
this scene from the poet himself, shewing with what
art it is introduced, and how naturally it is sustained.
Sir Richard Steele had deviated so much
from Terence in the original construction of his
fable, that he had no opportunity of working this
scene into it. Baron, who, I suppose, was afraid
to hazard it on the French theatre, fills up the
chasm by bringing Glycerium on the stage. She,
amused by Davus with a forged tale of the falsehood
of Pamphilus, throws herself at the feet of Chremes,
and prevails on him once more to break off the intended
match with Philumena. In consequence of
this alteration, the most lively part of the comedy
in Terence becomes the gravest in Baron: the artifice
of Davus is carried on with the most starch
formality, and the whole incident, as conducted in
the French imitation, loses all that air of ease and
pleasantry, which it wears in the original.”—<span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>

<i>That wealth, however, now devolves to me.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the island of Andros were subject
to the Athenian laws, which prohibited women
from bequeathing by will more than the value of a
medimnum (<span lang="el">μεδιμνον</span>) of barley. The medimnum
was equal to four English pecks and a half. Therefore,
as Chrysis had not the power of bequeathing
her property, Crito claimed it as heir at law. The
Athenian laws relating to wills were very numerous,
and very strict in guarding against an improper appropriation
of property. Slaves, foreigners, minors,
and adopted persons, as well as those who had
male heirs, were, by the laws of Solon, rendered
incapable of making a will.</p>

<p>Those persons who had no offspring of their own,
frequently adopted the children of others, who inherited
their estates. Sometimes foreigners were
adopted, after having received the freedom of the
city. A person who succeeded to the property of
another, as heir at law, was bound, under a heavy
penalty, to take care, (if on the spot,) that funeral
honours were paid to the deceased. This was reckoned
a point of great importance: the Greeks
were willing to proceed to any extremity rather than
suffer their friends to want the rites of sepulture,
as we see in <cite>Lucretius</cite>, who describes the outrageous
actions to which the people were driven during a
plague; when they committed acts of the greatest
violence, rather than permit their friends to want
funeral honours.</p>

<p>Here is an additional instance of Terence’s infinite

presenting to his readers a perfect copy of the customs

more expressive than words could have been.
Some of the ancients, the Greeks in particular,
studiously avoided, as much as possible, any
direct mention of death, which they accounted to
be ominous of evil; and always spoke of human
mortality, (when compelled to mention it,) in soft
and gentle expressions. They were even averse to
write <span lang="el">θανατος</span>, death, at full length; and not unfrequently
expressed it by the first letter <span lang="el">θ</span>; thus,

of Xenophon on the civil government of the Athenians,
can never perfectly comprehend the full
force of this passage. I profited by this information:
I have read this short treatise, and have
been extremely pleased with it: the trouble the
perusal cost me has been amply repaid, as I have
ascertained by reading this treatise, that the inhabitants
of those cities and islands which were subject
to the Athenian government were obliged, when
they had a suit at law pending, to plead it in
Athens, before the people: it could be decided no
where else. Crito, therefore, could not have expected
impartial judgment from that tribunal, which
would certainly have favoured Glycera, the reputed
sister of Chrysis, who had settled in Athens, in
preference to a stranger like Crito. So much for
the success of the affair: next the delays are to be
considered, which, to a stranger, are so doubly
annoying. For law-suits at Athens were protracted
to an almost endless length: the Athenians
were such a very litigious people, and had so many
law-suits of their own, and celebrated so many festivals,
that they had very few days to spare, and
the suits of strangers were so lengthened out, and
deferred from time to time, that they were almost
endless. In addition, moreover, to the uncertainty,
and the delay, there was a third inconvenience,
still more disagreeable than either of the
others, which was, that in a case of that kind, it
became necessary to pay court to the people at a
great expense. Crito, therefore, had sufficient
reason to feel repugnant to engage in a process
which might be so protracted and so expensive,
the event of which (to say no worse) was extremely
precarious. I hope I have rendered this passage
perfectly clear.”—<span class="smcap">Madame Dacier.</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Chremes.—Cease your entreaties, Simo; enough,
and more than enough, have I already shewn my
friendship towards you: enough have I risked
for you.</i></p>

<p>Monsieur Baron, in his Andrienne, has given a
literal translation of this scene between Simo and
Chremes, which, from its serious cast, appears,
perhaps, with more dignity in a poetical dress,
than it would have received from prose. A learned
translator of Terence, who was also an ingenious
critic and a successful dramatist, speaks of Baron’s
play in the following terms: “Its extreme elegance,
and great superiority to the <em>prose</em> translation
of Dacier, is a strong <em>proof</em> of the superior excellence
and propriety of a poetical translation of this
author:” (Terence.) <span class="smcap">Colman’s</span> <cite>Notes on Terence’s
Plays</cite>.</p>

<p>The celebrated writer, who made this remark, has
himself employed <em>verse</em> throughout the whole of his
translation of our author’s plays: and, in the preface
to that work, has delivered his opinion very
strongly in favour of the composition of comedy in
verse, even in the most comic scenes: and argues,
that as Terence wrote in verse, a translation of his
plays ought to be in verse also.</p>

<p>I must observe that though the comedies of
Terence certainly are not prose, yet they are a
species of verse so nearly approaching to prose,
that many eminent critics have denied that they
were written with any regard to measure: they are,
therefore, as well calculated, perhaps, as prose,
for comic expression. But we have in English no
measure at all similar to that used by Terence, nor
have we, in my opinion, any measure of verse
whatever, in which the most humorous passages
in comedy can be so forcibly expressed as they
may be in prose. The practice of modern dramatists
entirely favours this opinion. Our great
Shakspeare, <em>even in tragedy</em>, changes from verse to
prose, when he introduces a <em>comic</em> scene, as we see
in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <abbr title="Act 5 Scenes">A. 5. S.</abbr> 1, 4., <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, <abbr title="Act 2, Scene 1">A. 2. S. 1.</abbr>,

<abbr title="Act 2 Scene">A. 2. S.</abbr> 11, <abbr title="Act 2 Scene">A. 3. S.</abbr> 1. Could the wit of Congreve,
Farquhar, Cibber, Sheridan, and many other
eminent English dramatists (among whom I may
number Mr. Colman himself,) have been measured
out into verse without a diminution of the poignancy
of its expression? If the answer to this question be,
as I think it must, <em>in the negative</em>, it must surely
be decisive against the general introduction of verse
into comedies; a species of writing, in which <span class="allsmcap">THE
RIDICULOUS</span>, according to Aristotle, ought to claim
a principal share.</p>

<i>A citizen of Athens.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Athens, the most celebrated city of Greece, was
the capital of that part of Achaia, which, lying towards
the sea-shore, (<span lang="el">ἀκτὴ</span>,) was called Attica. It
was called <em>Athens</em> after Minerva, (<i>vide</i> <a href="#note_94">Note 94</a>,)
<em>Cecropia</em> after Cecrops, and <em>Ionia</em> after Ion. The
circumference of this city, at the time of its greatest
prosperity, is computed at twenty-three English
miles. A much greater space was enclosed within
the walls than was required by the usual inhabitants
of the city, because, in time of war, the country
people were compelled to take refuge within the
walls. Aristophanes tells us, (in his Knights,) that
these country people, in time of war, dwelt in huts,
resembling bee-hives in shape, which were erected
in the squares, and other open places.</p>

<p>This accounts for the magnitude of the city, so
disproportionate to the <em>usual</em> number of inhabitants
in time of peace, when they did not amount to a
hundred thousand persons. Athens was governed
by kings for the space of 460 years: by magistrates,
chosen for life, during about 300 years more: after
that time, their rulers were allowed to hold their
offices for ten years only; and, at last, for no
longer than one. The citadel, or upper city, which
was called the <span lang="el">Ἀκρόπολις</span>, was ornamented with the
most magnificent temples, monuments, and statues.
It contained the temples of Minerva, Neptune,
Aglauros, Venus, and Jupiter. Dicearchus tells
us, that the enormous disproportion in the size of
the temples which were magnificent, and of the
houses which were low and small, considerably diminished
the beauty of the city. Athens was sometimes
called the academy of the Roman empire, and
the fountain of learning: learned men, and philosophers
of different countries, resorted to this celebrated
city in great numbers. The Romans scarcely
considered a liberal education as completed, without
the student received his final polish at Athens.
(<i>Vide Horace <abbr title="Satires">Sat.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="Book 2, Scene 7, Line 13">B. 2. S. 7. L. 13.</abbr>, <cite>Pliny</cite>, 7.
E. 56.) After a career of glory, which must render
the name of Athens immortal, that city sunk beneath
the all-conquering power of the Romans,
B.&nbsp;C. 85; and the Athenians never regained their
importance in the scale of nations.</p>

<p>Athens is now called Setines; Dr. Chandler
gives it the name of Athini. It contains 15,000 inhabitants,
and is the see of a Greek archbishop.</p>

<i>Simo.—Seize this rascal directly, and take him away.</i><br>
<br>
——<span lang="la"><em>Sublimem</em> hunc intrò rape quantum potes.</span>
</p>

<p>There is a sort of pun here upon the word <em>sublimem</em>.
Terence alludes to the prisons where slaves
were confined, which, in Athens, were usually in
the loftiest part of the house: so that Simo says,
take him <em>up</em>, and also take him <em>up to the top of
the house</em>: this is the force of the word <em>sublimem</em> in
this passage.</p>

<p>Slaves, in Greece, were treated with great indulgence,
and never chained but for some heinous
fault, or when they were brought into the slave-market,
(<cite>vide Plautus’s Captives</cite>, <abbr title="Act 1 Scene 2">A. 1. S. 2</abbr>,) and
then they were only worn for a short time. As
Simo here commands that Davus should be put
into chains, we are to suppose him to be exasperated
to the utmost, which naturally leads <i lang="la">ad finem
epitaseos</i>, to the end of the epitasis. The anger of
<em>Simo</em>, the distress of <em>Pamphilus</em> and <em>Glycera</em>, the
imprisonment of <em>Davus</em>, and the anxious suspense of
<em>Charinus</em>, are what Scaliger (<cite>Poet</cite>, <abbr title="Book 1 Chapter 9">B. 1. C. 9.</abbr>) calls
the <cite lang="la">negotia exagitata</cite>, or the confused and disturbed
state of affairs, which the <em>catastrophe</em> is to
reduce <i lang="la">in tranquillitatem non expectatam</i>, into a
sudden and unexpected tranquillity.</p>

<p class="hanging" lang="la"><i>D.</i> Tamen etsi hoc verum est.</p>
<p class="hanging" lang="la"><i>S.</i> Tamen. Cura adservandum vinctum.</p>

<p>The word <em>commotum</em> seems to have been imperfectly
understood by Donatus and some other commentators,
who have interpreted it as signifying
motion; and would translate the line thus, “I’ll
make you caper! I’ll make you dance to some
tune, sirrah!” which is extremely foreign to its true
meaning. Simo uses the phrase <cite>commotum</cite> reddam
instead of <cite>commovebo</cite>, for the sake of a pun which
Terence makes with the word <cite>reddam</cite>: which cannot
be perfectly preserved in English.</p>

<p>In the seventh scene of the second act, Davus
jests upon the empty larder, and says,</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Indeed, Sir, I think you are too frugal: it is not well timed.</i></p>

<p>Simo is quite nettled at this severe joke, which
leads him to think his stratagem discovered, and
he cries out <cite>Tace: hold your tongue</cite>; upon which,
Davus, delighted with his success in tormenting
his master, says to himself Commovi, <cite>I’ve ruffled
him now.</cite> Simo accidentally overhears this, and
most severely retorts on him his own expression,</p>

<p class="hanging"><span lang="la">Ego jam te commotum reddam</span>: <cite>I will ruffle you
now, rascal; I will pay you back your ruffling.</cite></p>

<p>The wit of the sentence depends on the word <em>reddam</em>;
which allows of a double construction, as
<em>reddo</em> taken separately, signifies <dfn>to pay back</dfn>, <dfn>to requite</dfn>,
and <dfn>to retaliate</dfn>. Simo may, therefore, be
understood to say, that he pays him back the ruffling
he received. But, for this conceit, Simo
would have said, Commovebo, which is Davus’s
own word: the sense would then have been clearer,
though Terence has the same expression in another
scene in this play,</p>

<p class="center" lang="la">
Quos me ludos redderet,<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">where <em>reddo</em> has the same meaning with facio:
which is frequently used by Plautus, as “<cite lang="la">ludos
facere</cite>.”</p>

<i>Can he be so weak? so totally regardless of the customs
and laws of his country?</i><br>
</p>

<p>The Athenian laws prohibited a citizen from marrying
with a woman who was not a citizen, <i>vide</i>
<a href="#note_181">Note 181</a>. A law was passed by Pericles, that the
children of a marriage in which both parties were
not citizens, should be considered as <span lang="el">νοθοι</span>, illegitimate.
Pericles himself violated this law, when he
had lost all his legitimate children.</p>

<p>As this is one of the most lively and interesting,
so it is also one of the most instructive scenes of
this comedy. How noble are the sentiments! How
engaging the mutual affection of the father and son,
which, in spite of their disagreement, is visible in
all they say to each other. How amiable are the
efforts of Chremes to soften the anger of the justly-offended
Simo! He forgets his own disappointment,
and the slight his daughter Philumena had received
from Pamphilus, and endeavours to reconcile him
to his father. It is impossible to read this beautiful
scene, without being both affected and improved by
the perusal of it.</p>

<i>Persons are suborned hither too, who say that she is

<p>The subornation of false witness was punished in
Athens with the greatest severity. Both the suborner
and the perjured were subject to the same
punishment. Upon a third conviction, the offender
was branded with infamy, and forfeited his estate.
The Athenians, in general, were so celebrated for
their love of truth, that the words <cite>an Attic witness</cite>
were used proverbially to designate a witness,

<i>If you insist on your marriage with Philumena, and
compel me to subdue my love for Glycera, I will
endeavour to comply.</i></p>

<p>This speech is exceedingly artificial. Pamphilus,
<em>in the hearing of Chremes, the father of his intended
wife</em>, confesses his love for another; and owns,
that it must cost him a severe struggle to conquer
his affection for her, and resolve to wed Philumena.
The knowledge of this was sufficient to deter
Chremes from giving his daughter to Pamphilus.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>I implore only, that you will cease to accuse me of

<p>“Pamphilus had all the reason in the world to
endeavour to bring Simo and Crito together, that so
he might clear himself of such a scandal as his father
very reasonably imputed to him. And this
was all the young gentleman’s design, but the poet
had a far greater, which the audience could not so
much as suspect: namely, the discovery of Glycerie,
which comes in very naturally.”—<span class="smcap">Echard.</span></p>

<i>Chremes.—Simo, if you knew this stranger as well as
I do, you would think better of him; he is a worthy
man.</i></p>

<p>M. Baron in this and the following scenes gives
almost a literal translation from Terence: and the
Andrienne concludes exactly in the same manner
with the Latin play; excepting the affranchisement
of Davus, with which M. Baron makes Pamphilus
reward his faithful services.</p>

<p>In the Conscious Lovers, Sir R. Steele changes
Crito into Isabella, the aunt of Indiana, whose real
birth is discovered by Sealand’s making her a visit,
to inquire into the nature of her connexion with
young Bevil: the discovery is made by Sealand
himself, who recognizes one of the ornaments worn
by his daughter. He gives Indiana willingly to her
preserver Bevil, jun., and Lucinda, who was intended
to be the wife of Bevil, was, upon his marriage
with her sister Indiana, given to Myrtle, the
lover whom she herself had always favoured.</p>

<i>Simo.—A sycophant.</i><br>
</p>

<p>The word sycophant was an epithet of peculiar
opprobrium at Athens, and of very singular derivation.
In a season of great scarcity, a law was
passed at Athens, prohibiting the exportation of
figs; and afterwards, through neglect, remained
unrepealed. Hence, those malicious men who
informed against those who transgressed it, were
called <span lang="el">συκοφάνται</span>, and this appellation was afterwards
always applied to false witnesses, and busy
and malicious informers.</p>

<p>The word <em>recepit</em>, in this sentence, alludes to the

Rome, he was said <dfn>applicare</dfn>, <dfn>to apply</dfn> to some
person to become his patron; as every stranger at
Rome was compelled to obtain the protection of one
of the citizens, who succeeded to his effects at his
death: <span lang="la">jure applicationis</span>. When a Roman citizen
agreed to accept of a foreigner as his client, he was
said <dfn>recipere</dfn>, to receive him.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Crito.—At least I think it was Phania: one thing
I am sure of, he said he was from Rhamnus.</i></p>

<p>Rhamnus was a small town in the north of Attica,
and only a few miles to the north-west of Marathon.
It seems to have been famous for little but a
magnificent temple of Nemesis, and an exquisite
statue of that goddess, sculptured by Phidias;
hence she was sometimes called Rhamnusia, thus
by Ovid,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>We must not understand Crito to mean, that
Phania was a Rhamnusian, because we know that
he and Chremes both resided in the city of Athens.
Phania probably was prevented, by the confusion of
the war, from obtaining a vessel at the Piræus, or
either of the Athenian ports; and therefore returned
to Rhamnus, and embarked for the opposite coast
of Attica. Phania might, therefore, call himself
Rhamnusius from Rhamnus, as being bound from
Rhamnus to Smyrna, or any other Asian port.
Some, instead of Rhamnus and Rhamnusius, read
Rhamus and Rhamusius.</p>

<i>Crito.—The very name.</i><br>
<i>Chremes.—You are right.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Crito.—<span lang="la">Ipsa est.</span> Chremes.—<span lang="la">Ea est.</span></i> Terence
has shewn his usual art in the arrangement of these
two speeches. Upon hearing the true name, one
would have expected that the father would have
been the first to recognize it, but he prudently delays
until Crito confirms the truth of his testimony
by agreeing to the name of the long-lost Pasibula.
This is finely imagined by the author, as Chremes
might very well be supposed to suspect that this
discovery was a trick of Davus’, (who might have
heard of the loss of this infant daughter,) and
taken Crito for an accomplice in the conceived imposture.
Chremes, therefore, waited to know whether
Crito recognised the name of Pasibula, which,
if the story had been false, must have been unknown
to him: for the high character of Pamphilus
placed him beyond the reach of suspicion.</p>

<p>In many of the old editions of our author, this

<p>Some commentators interpret these words from
Pamphilus and Simo, (Nempe and Scilicet,) as a
hint to Chremes, respecting the dowry which they
expected to receive with Glycera; and think that
the actor who personates Simo ought to produce a
bag of money, that he may “<cite>suit the action to the
word</cite>.” An ingenious critic, speaking of this vague
and fanciful conjecture, observes, as follows:
“This, surely, is a precious refinement, worthy
the genius of a true commentator. Madame Dacier,
who entertains a just veneration for Donatus,
doubts the authenticity of the observation, which is
ascribed to him.” Certainly, if either of the words
could be wrested to such a meaning, it must be
<em>Nempe</em>, but Terence has represented Pamphilus as
a character, so noble, generous, and high-spirited,
that we cannot consistently suppose that he would
suffer any mercenary considerations to delay for a
single moment his acceptance of his beloved Glycera,
when offered to him by her father.</p>

her removal to our house?</i><br>
</p>

<p>Grecian women, in the situation in which Glycera
is represented to have been, were usually well
enough to go abroad in a litter in one day’s time.
This topic is introduced by the poet, in order that
Davus may be spoken of, and delivered from confinement;
because his remaining in prison would
have been contrary to the rules of comedy.</p>

deemed allowable. The critics remark, that Terence,
by Simo’s pleasantry, (<i>vide <a href="#note_211">Note 211</a></i>,) intended

est: <em>rectè</em></span> has a double meaning, it signifies <dfn>rightly</dfn>,
and also <dfn>straight</dfn>. Simo pretends to take it in the
latter sense, which makes his son’s speech run
thus, <cite>He is not bound straight or upright</cite>: to which
Simo replies, <cite>I ordered he should not be bound
straight, but crooked</cite>, or neck and heels. I trust
I have made the force of this pun clear to the unlearned

<p class="hanging"><i>Pam. (to himself.)—Any one would think, perhaps,
that I do not believe this to be true, but I know it
is because I wish it so. I am of opinion, that the
lives of the gods are eternal, because their pleasures

<p>“Epicurus observed, that the gods could not but
be immortal, since they are exempt from all kinds of
evils, cares, and dangers. But Terence gives another
more refined reason, which more forcibly expresses
the joy of Pamphilus; for he affirms that
their immortality springs only from the durability
of their pleasures. This passage is very beautiful.
Pamphilus prefaces what he is going to say by the
expression, “<cite>Any one would think, perhaps</cite>;” this
was in a manner necessary to excuse the freedom
which, arising from his joy, makes him assign

husband’s house, in a ceremonial procession. For

cake made of meal and salt. The second kind of
marriage was <dfn>usus</dfn>, when the parties lived together
for one year. The third kind was called <dfn>coemptio</dfn>
or mutual purchase, in which the bride and bridegroom
gave each other a piece of money, and repeated
over a set form of words.</p>

<p>The optative influence, (if I may so call it,) on the

<i>You must not expect their coming out.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Some editors give nearly twenty lines of dialogue
between Chremes and Charinus respecting the
marriage of the latter with Philumena, but those
additional lines are spurious. The critics have decided
that the play should terminate with the winding
up of Pamphilus’s intrigue, and that that of
Charinus should be left to the imagination: as the
action must languish, if continued after the interest
felt for the principal characters has subsided.
Davus here addresses the spectators, as does Mysis,
in <abbr title="Act 1 Scene 4">A. 1. S. 4.</abbr> Commentators deem this a blemish
in the composition of the piece. These addresses,
in ancient comedies, were not, I imagine,
made to the spectators in general, but to those persons
who stood on the stage during the performance,
as the chorus, or as musicians.</p>

<i>Farewell, and clap your hands.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“All the ancient copies have the Greek omega,
<abbr title="Omega" lang="el">Ω</abbr>, placed before the words, ‘<cite>clap your hands</cite>,’
and before ‘<cite>Farewell, and clap your hands</cite>,’ in
other plays: ‘which,’ says Eugraphius, ‘are the
words of the prompter, who, at the end of the
play, lifted up the curtain, and said to the audience,
‘<cite>Farewell, and clap your hands</cite>:’ thus far
Faernus. Leng, at the end of every play, subscribes
these words, Calliopius recensui, and says
Calliopius was the prompter; and he quotes the
same words of Eugraphius, which I have here
quoted from Faernus. If <abbr title="Omega" lang="el">Ω</abbr> stands for any thing
more than ‘<cite>Finis</cite>,’ (as some imagine to be placed
there by transcribers to signify the end,) it may be
designed for the first letter <span lang="el">Ωδος</span>, which is the Greek
for Cantor: and Horace, in his art of poetry, says,</p>

<p class="center">
Donec cantor vos plaudite dicat.<br>
</p>

<p>“Bentley supposes this Cantor to have been Flaccus
the musician, (<cite>mentioned in the title</cite>,) who,
when the play was over, entreated the favour of the
audience: but I should rather think Calliopius to
have been the Cantor, if there was any foundation
in antiquity for his name being at the end of the
plays; but the name seems fictitious to me by the
etymology thereof, and it being used in this place.
It is indeed at the end of every play, in all the
<em>three manuscripts in Dr. Mead’s</em> collection except
Phormio, which is the last play in the prosaic
copy; and the only reason for Calliopius recensui
not being there, is, doubtless, because the play is
imperfect, some few verses being out at the conclusion;
<abbr title="omega" lang="el">ω</abbr> precedes the farewell in one of the
doctor’s copies, <abbr title="omicron" lang="el">ο</abbr> in another, and the largest copy
has neither. What is independent of the action of
the play, as the last two lines are, may be looked
upon as an epilogue, and was probably spoken by
the same person, whether <em>player</em>, <em>prompter</em>, or
<em>cantor</em>.”—<span class="smcap">Cooke.</span></p>

<i>End of the fifth Act.</i><br>
</p>

<p>At the end of a play, the Romans closed their
scenes, which, instead of falling from the roof of
the theatre downwards, as among the moderns,
were constructed something similarly to the blinds
of a carriage; so that when the stage was to be
exposed to the view of the spectators, the scene or
curtain was let down, and when the piece was concluded,
it was drawn up again. The ancients originally
performed their plays in the open air, with
no scenery but that furnished by nature. As they
became more refined, they erected theatres, and
introduced scenes, which they divided into three
kinds: 1. tragic, 2. comic, 3. pastoral. Some
very valuable information on this subject may be
gathered from M. Perrault’s Notes on Vitruvius,
who has described the various sorts of ancient
scenes. Ovid, in the following verses, describes
the original simplicity of the Roman dramatic entertainments:</p>
